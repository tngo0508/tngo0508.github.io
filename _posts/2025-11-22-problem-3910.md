## Problem Statement

[leetcode problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-operations-to-make-all-elements-divisible-by-three/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-11-22)

## Brute Force [Accepted]

````python
class Solution:
    def minimumOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        arr = []
        for num in nums:
            if num % 3 != 0:
                arr.append(num)

        for x in arr:
            temp = x
            count1 = 0
            while temp % 3 != 0:
                temp += 1
                count1 += 1
            temp = x
            count2 = 0
            while temp % 3 != 0:
                temp -= 1
                count2 += 1

            res += min(count1, count2)

        return res
        ```
````

## Editorial

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        return sum(min(x % 3, 3 - x % 3) for x in nums)
```
