## Problem Statement

![problem](/assets/images/2024-09-08_09-32-39-1229.png)

## Intuition

When I first looked at this problem, I realized that it is about finding a common time slot between two people's available slots. My first thought is that sorting both time slot lists will help in comparing them more easily. By sorting, I can then focus on checking the overlapping slots to see if the overlap is long enough to fit the required duration.

## Approach

The approach is to first sort both lists of available slots. Then, I compare intervals from each list to find overlapping sections. I go through each pair of intervals, checking if their overlap is greater than or equal to the required duration. If I find such an overlap, I return the start and end time of that overlap. To achieve this, I use two pointers, one for each list of slots, and move them based on the end times of the current intervals.

## Complexity

- Time complexity:
  Sorting both slot lists will take $$O(n \log n)$$, where $$n$$ is the number of slots in the longer list. After sorting, we traverse both lists, which is $$O(n + m)$$ where $$n$$ and $$m$$ are the lengths of the two lists. Overall, the time complexity is $$O(n \log n + m \log m)$$.

- Space complexity:
  The space complexity is $$O(1)$$, since we are using constant extra space beyond the input lists.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def minAvailableDuration(self, slots1: List[List[int]], slots2: List[List[int]], duration: int) -> List[int]:
        i = j = 0
        slots1.sort()
        slots2.sort()
        len1, len2 = len(slots1), len(slots2)
        while i < len1 and j < len2:
            start1, end1 = slots1[i]
            start2, end2 = slots2[j]
            if start1 <= start2 < end1:
                if min(end1, end2) - start2 >= duration:
                    return [start2, start2 + duration]

            elif start2 <= start1 < end2:
                if min(end2, end1) - start1 >= duration:
                    return [start1, start1 + duration]

            if end1 < end2:
                i += 1
            else:
                j += 1
        return []
```

## Editorial

### Approach 1: Two pointers

```python
class Solution:
    def minAvailableDuration(self, slots1: List[List[int]], slots2: List[List[int]], duration: int) -> List[int]:

        slots1.sort()
        slots2.sort()
        pointer1 = pointer2 = 0

        while pointer1 < len(slots1) and pointer2 < len(slots2):
            # find the boundaries of the intersection, or the common slot
            intersect_right = min(slots1[pointer1][1], slots2[pointer2][1])
            intersect_left = max(slots1[pointer1][0],slots2[pointer2][0])
            if intersect_right - intersect_left >= duration:
                return [intersect_left, intersect_left + duration]
            # always move the one that ends earlier
            if slots1[pointer1][1]< slots2[pointer2][1]:
                pointer1 += 1
            else:
                pointer2 += 1
        return []
```

- time: O(MlogM + NlogN)
- space: O(1)

### Approach 2: Heap

```python
class Solution:
    def minAvailableDuration(self, slots1: List[List[int]], slots2: List[List[int]], duration: int) -> List[int]:
        # build up a heap containing time slots last longer than duration
        timeslots = list(filter(lambda x: x[1] - x[0] >= duration, slots1 + slots2))
        heapq.heapify(timeslots)

        while len(timeslots) > 1:
            start1, end1 = heapq.heappop(timeslots)
            start2, end2 = timeslots[0]
            if end1 >= start2 + duration:
                return [start2, start2 + duration]
        return []
```

- time: O((M + N) log (M + N))
- space: O(M + N)
