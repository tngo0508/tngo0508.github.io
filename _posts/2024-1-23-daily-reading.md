# My Daily Reading
Today, I learned about the truth of ability and accomplishment. It takes a significant amount of time and effort to develop one's skills. Many successful figures, like Darwin, dedicated years of work and numerous discussions to achieve success. In this chapter, I also discovered the key ingredients in achievement: consistency and perseverance through hardships.

The real lesson is about maintaining a growth mindset, as opposed to a fixed mindset. I used to doubt my abilities after setbacks, making it difficult to bounce back and stay on track. Reflecting on my time at UCLA for pre-med education, I recall facing challenges and getting bad grades in biochemistry and biology. With a fixed mindset, I believed a career in medicine or pharmacy was not for me.

Now, I realize that my mindset can change along with my abilities. Looking back, if I had persevered through those challenges, I could have pursued a career as a medical doctor or pharmacist. The fear of failure tends to make those with a fixed mindset panic and doubt themselves, while those with a growth mindset mobilize their efforts for learning.

The author also touched on the low-effort syndrome, where individuals with a fixed mindset try to achieve their goals with minimal effort to protect their egos. In contrast, those with a growth mindset embrace continuous learning, trying new ideas, and finding new ways to solve problems. That's my takeaway from this reading session.
