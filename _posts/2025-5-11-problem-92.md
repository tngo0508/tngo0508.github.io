## Problem Statement

[leetcode problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list-ii/description/)

## Brute Force [Accepted]

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseBetween(self, head: Optional[ListNode], left: int, right: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = ListNode(-1, head)
        curr = dummy
        left_node = right_node = curr
        prev_left = next_right = curr
        for _ in range(left):
            prev_left = curr
            curr = curr.next
            left_node = curr

        curr = head
        for _ in range(right):
            right_node = curr
            curr = curr.next
            next_right = right_node.next

        curr = left_node
        prev = None
        while curr and curr is not next_right:
            next_node = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = next_node

        if prev_left and prev_left is not right_node:
            prev_left.next = right_node
        if left_node and left_node is not next_right:
            left_node.next = next_right

        return dummy.next
```

## Editorial

### Approach 2: Iterative Link Reversal.

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseBetween(
        self, head: Optional[ListNode], m: int, n: int
    ) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # Empty list
        if not head:
            return None

        # Move the two pointers until they reach the proper starting point
        # in the list.
        cur, prev = head, None
        while m > 1:
            prev = cur
            cur = cur.next
            m, n = m - 1, n - 1

        # The two pointers that will fix the final connections.
        tail, con = cur, prev

        # Iteratively reverse the nodes until n becomes 0.
        while n:
            third = cur.next
            cur.next = prev
            prev = cur
            cur = third
            n -= 1

        # Adjust the final connections as explained in the algorithm
        if con:
            con.next = prev
        else:
            head = prev
        tail.next = cur
        return head
```
