## Problem Statement

[leetcode problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-equal-sum-of-two-arrays-after-replacing-zeros/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-05-10)

## Intuition

We are given two integer arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, which may contain zeros. The goal is to make the sums of both arrays equal, or determine it's not possible. We are allowed to **replace any zero with any positive integer**, but to **minimize the final sum**, we should always replace zeros with the smallest possible value: `1`.

## Why Replace `0` with `1`

Zeros represent flexible values that can be changed to any positive number. Since our goal is to **minimize the final sum**, we replace each `0` with the smallest valid value, which is `1`. This strategy gives us the **minimum possible sum** for the array and allows us to determine if it's even possible to match the sums between the two arrays.

## Why It's Impossible Without Any Zeros

If one array has a smaller total sum **and contains no zeros**, it's **impossible** to increase its sum to match the other array because:

- We are **not allowed to modify non-zero values**.
- The only way to **increase an array’s sum** is by replacing zeros with larger numbers.
- So, if there are **no zeros to replace**, we have **no control** over that array's total — it's fixed.

Hence, when the smaller-sum array has no zeros, we **cannot make the two arrays equal in sum**, and the function must return `-1`.

## Approach

1. Clone `nums1` and `nums2` to avoid modifying the input.
2. Replace every `0` in the clones with `1`.
3. Compute the sum of the modified arrays.
4. If one sum is smaller and the original array has **no zeros**, it's **impossible** to match — return `-1`.
5. Otherwise, return the **larger of the two sums**, since that’s the minimal total where both arrays can be equal.

## Complexity

- **Time complexity:**  
  $$O(n + m)$$ — we iterate over both arrays once.

- **Space complexity:**  
  $$O(n + m)$$ — we create clones of both arrays.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def minSum(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> int:
        clone_nums1 = nums1[:]
        clone_nums2 = nums2[:]
        for i in range(len(clone_nums1)):
            if clone_nums1[i] == 0:
                clone_nums1[i] = 1

        for i in range(len(clone_nums2)):
            if clone_nums2[i] == 0:
                clone_nums2[i] = 1

        sum1 = sum(clone_nums1)
        sum2 = sum(clone_nums2)
        if sum1 < sum2 and 0 not in nums1:
            return -1
        if sum2 < sum1 and 0 not in nums2:
            return -1

        return max(sum1, sum2)
```

## Editorial

### Approach: Classified Discussion

```python
class Solution:
    def minSum(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> int:
        sum1 = sum2 = 0
        zero1 = zero2 = 0

        for i in nums1:
            sum1 += i
            if i == 0:
                sum1 += 1
                zero1 += 1

        for i in nums2:
            sum2 += i
            if i == 0:
                sum2 += 1
                zero2 += 1

        if (zero1 == 0 and sum2 > sum1) or (zero2 == 0 and sum1 > sum2):
            return -1

        return max(sum1, sum2)
```
