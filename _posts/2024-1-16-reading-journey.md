## Introduction

I aim to cultivate a reading habit to enhance both my reading and writing skills. Recognizing a deficiency in my vocabulary, despite having read numerous English books, I've decided to embark on an experiment to significantly improve this aspect in the coming year.

## Reading Plan

I've formulated a plan that is both feasible and geared toward achieving both short-term and long-term goals. My plan involves dedicating at least one hour every day to reading. While doing so, I intend to make a note of any words or vocabulary that I find unfamiliar. This approach is aimed at facilitating better learning and understanding of these words.

In contrast to my previous method of immediately looking up unfamiliar words on my phone, which resulted in a temporary understanding, I now plan to write down these words in a journal or post. Later, I will look them up and construct sentences using them, aiming for a more lasting retention.

## Progress Tracking

Additionally, I want to monitor my progress by planning the books I intend to read throughout the year or month. After reading a book, I plan to summarize what I have learned, testing my comprehension of the main ideas or thoughts conveyed by the authors.

## Book List

Here is a table containing the books I read last year, some of which I may revisit for a better understanding or enjoyment, and the books I plan to read this month or year:
