## Problem Statement

![problem](/assets/images/2024-12-05_19-37-15-problem-2554.png)

## Intuition

The problem can be approached by iteratively considering all numbers from 1 to `n` and determining whether they can be included in the sum without violating the constraints:

1. The number must not be in the banned list.
2. The cumulative sum of the selected numbers must not exceed `maxSum`.

This approach ensures that we maximize the count of numbers that can be included while adhering to the restrictions.

## Approach

1. Convert the `banned` list into a set for O(1) lookup times.
2. Initialize variables `res` to keep track of the current sum and `count` to count the numbers added.
3. Iterate through numbers from 1 to `n`:
   - Skip the number if it is banned.
   - Skip the number if adding it would exceed `maxSum`.
   - Otherwise, add the number to the cumulative sum (`res`) and increment the count (`count`).
4. Return the total count of numbers added.

## Complexity

- **Time complexity**:  
  $$O(n)$$  
  Iterating through numbers from 1 to `n` takes O(n), and checking membership in the banned set is O(1).

- **Space complexity**:  
  $$O(b)$$  
  Where `b` is the size of the `banned` list, as it is converted into a set.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def maxCount(self, banned: List[int], n: int, maxSum: int) -> int:
        banned_numbers = set(banned)
        res = 0
        count = 0
        for x in range(1, n + 1):
            if x in banned_numbers:
                continue
            if res + x > maxSum:
                continue
            res += x
            count += 1
        return count
```

## Editorial

### Approach 1: Binary Search

```python
class Solution:
    def maxCount(self, banned: List[int], n: int, maxSum: int) -> int:
        # Sort banned array to enable binary search
        banned.sort()
        count = 0

        # Try each number from 1 to n
        for num in range(1, n + 1):
            # Skip if number is in banned array
            if self._custom_binary_search(banned, num):
                continue

            maxSum -= num
            # Break if sum exceeds our limit
            if maxSum < 0:
                break

            count += 1

        return count

    def _custom_binary_search(self, arr: List[int], target: int) -> bool:
        left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1

        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if arr[mid] == target:
                return True
            if arr[mid] > target:
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                left = mid + 1

        return False
```

### Approach 2: Sweep

```python
class Solution:
    def maxCount(self, banned: list[int], n: int, maxSum: int) -> int:
        # Sort the banned list
        banned.sort()

        banned_idx = 0
        count = 0

        # Check each number from 1 to n while the sum is valid
        for num in range(1, n + 1):
            # Skip if the current number is in the banned list
            if banned_idx < len(banned) and banned[banned_idx] == num:
                # Handle duplicate banned numbers
                while banned_idx < len(banned) and banned[banned_idx] == num:
                    banned_idx += 1
            else:
                # Include the current number if possible
                maxSum -= num
                if maxSum >= 0:
                    count += 1
                else:
                    break

        return count
```

### Approach 3: Hash Set

```python
class Solution:
    def maxCount(self, banned: list[int], n: int, maxSum: int) -> int:
        # Store banned numbers in a set for quick lookup
        banned_set = set(banned)

        count = 0

        # Try each number from 1 to n
        for num in range(1, n + 1):
            # Skip banned numbers
            if num in banned_set:
                continue

            # Return if adding the current number exceeds maxSum
            if maxSum - num < 0:
                return count

            # Include current number
            maxSum -= num
            count += 1

        return count
```
