## Problem Statement

![problem](/assets/images/2025-03-05_17-03-31-problem-2965.jpg)

## Brute Force [Accepted]

```python
class Solution:
    def findMissingAndRepeatedValues(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        N = len(grid)
        seen = set()
        a, b = 0, 0
        for row in range(N):
            for col in range(N):
                if grid[row][col] in seen:
                    a = grid[row][col]
                seen.add(grid[row][col])

        for i in range(1, N*N + 1):
            if i not in seen:
                b = i
        return [a, b]
```

## Editorial

### Approach 1: Hash Map

```python
class Solution:
    def findMissingAndRepeatedValues(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(grid)
        freq = {}

        # Store frequency of each number in the grid
        for row in grid:
            for num in row:
                freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1

        # Check numbers from 1 to n^2 to find missing and repeated values
        for num in range(1, n * n + 1):
            if num not in freq:
                missing = num  # Number not present in grid
            elif freq[num] == 2:
                repeat = num  # Number appears twice

        return [repeat, missing]
```

### Approach 2: Math

```python
class Solution:
    def findMissingAndRepeatedValues(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        # Get grid dimensions
        n = len(grid)
        total = n * n

        # Calculate actual sums from grid
        sum_val = sum(num for row in grid for num in row)
        sqr_sum = sum(num * num for row in grid for num in row)

        # Calculate differences from expected sums
        # Expected sum: n(n+1)/2, Expected square sum: n(n+1)(2n+1)/6
        sum_diff = sum_val - total * (total + 1) // 2
        sqr_diff = sqr_sum - total * (total + 1) * (2 * total + 1) // 6

        # Using math: If x is repeated and y is missing
        # sum_diff = x - y
        # sqr_diff = x² - y²
        repeat = (sqr_diff // sum_diff + sum_diff) // 2
        missing = (sqr_diff // sum_diff - sum_diff) // 2

        return [repeat, missing]
```
