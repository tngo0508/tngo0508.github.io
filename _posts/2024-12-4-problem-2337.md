## Problem Statement

![problem](/assets/images/2024-12-04_18-42-27-problem-2337.png)

## Intuition

When I first looked at this problem, I noticed that the movement of characters `L` and `R` is constrained by the fact that `L` can only move to the left and `R` can only move to the right. This led me to the realization that the order and types of non-underscore (`_`) characters must be identical in both `start` and `target`, and their positions must also respect these movement constraints.

## Approach

My approach begins by isolating the characters and their indices from both the `start` and `target` strings, ignoring underscores (`_`). This helps to focus only on the significant movements of `L` and `R`.

1. First, I extract two lists: one for the characters (`start_str` and `target_str`) and one for their indices (`start_index` and `target_index`).
2. I then compare the extracted characters (`start_str` and `target_str`). If they are not identical, it is impossible to rearrange `start` into `target`.
3. Next, I iterate through the indices to ensure that each `L` in `start` is not attempting to move right (by checking that its index is greater than or equal to its corresponding index in `target`). Similarly, each `R` in `start` must not move left (its index must be less than or equal to its target index).

If all these checks pass, then it is possible to transform `start` into `target`.

## Complexity

- **Time complexity**: $$O(n)$$  
  Extracting the characters and indices from both strings involves a single pass through each string, and the final comparison involves iterating through the indices, which is linear.

- **Space complexity**: $$O(n)$$  
  Additional space is used to store the extracted characters and their indices for both strings.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def canChange(self, start: str, target: str) -> bool:
        start_str = []
        start_index = []
        target_str = []
        target_index = []

        for i, c in enumerate(start):
            if c != '_':
                start_str.append(c)
                start_index.append(i)

        for i, c in enumerate(target):
            if c != '_':
                target_str.append(c)
                target_index.append(i)

        if start_str != target_str:
            return False

        for i in range(len(target_index)):
            if start_str[i] == 'L' and start_index[i] < target_index[i]:
                return False
            if start_str[i] == 'R' and start_index[i] > target_index[i]:
                return False

        return True
```

## Editorial

### Approach 2: Using Queue

```python
class Solution:
    def canChange(self, start: str, target: str) -> bool:
        # Queue to store characters and indices from both strings
        start_queue = []
        target_queue = []

        # Record non-underscore characters and their indices
        for i in range(len(start)):
            if start[i] != "_":
                start_queue.append((start[i], i))
            if target[i] != "_":
                target_queue.append((target[i], i))

        # If number of pieces don't match, return false
        if len(start_queue) != len(target_queue):
            return False

        # Compare each piece's type and position
        while not len(start_queue) == 0:
            start_char, start_index = start_queue.pop(0)
            target_char, target_index = target_queue.pop(0)

            # Check character match and movement rules
            if (
                start_char != target_char
                or (start_char == "L" and start_index < target_index)
                or (start_char == "R" and start_index > target_index)
            ):
                return False

        return True
```

### Approach 3: Two pointer

```python
class Solution:
    def canChange(self, start: str, target: str) -> bool:
        start_length = len(start)
        # pointers for start string and target string
        start_index, target_index = (0, 0)

        while start_index < start_length or target_index < start_length:
            # skip underscores in start
            while start_index < start_length and start[start_index] == "_":
                start_index += 1

            # skip underscores in target
            while target_index < start_length and target[target_index] == "_":
                target_index += 1

            # if one string exhausted, both strings should be exhausted
            if start_index == start_length or target_index == start_length:
                return (
                    start_index == start_length and target_index == start_length
                )

            # check if the pieces match and follow movement rules
            if (
                start[start_index] != target[target_index]
                or (start[start_index] == "L" and start_index < target_index)
                or (start[start_index] == "R" and start_index > target_index)
            ):
                return False

            start_index += 1
            target_index += 1

        # if all conditions satisfied, return true
        return True
```
