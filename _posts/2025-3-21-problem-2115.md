## Problem Statement

![problem](/assets/images/2025-03-21_12-47-05-problem-2115.jpg)

## Intuition

The problem requires determining which recipes can be made given a list of available supplies and dependencies between ingredients and recipes. The natural way to approach this is by treating it as a directed graph problem where recipes depend on ingredients. Recipes can be prepared if all their required ingredients are available in the initial supplies or can be derived from other recipes.

## Approach

The approach is based on **topological sorting (Kahn's Algorithm)**:

1. **Graph Construction**: Construct a directed graph where each ingredient points to the recipes that depend on it. Also, maintain an in-degree dictionary to track dependencies for each recipe.
2. **Queue Initialization**: Start with all the supplies (since they require no dependencies) and add them to a queue.
3. **Processing Recipes**: Perform a BFS-like process where we check recipes whose dependencies are met. If an ingredient is available, reduce the in-degree of dependent recipes. When a recipeâ€™s in-degree becomes zero, it means all required ingredients are available, so we can add it to the queue and eventually to the result.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: $$O(N + M)$$ where:
  - $$N$$ is the number of recipes and ingredients combined (nodes in the graph).
  - $$M$$ is the number of dependencies (edges in the graph).
- **Space Complexity**: $$O(N + M)$$ for storing the graph and in-degree dictionary.

## Code

```python
from collections import deque
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def findAllRecipes(self, recipes: List[str], ingredients: List[List[str]], supplies: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        graph = {}
        res = []
        queue = deque()
        indegree = {}

        # Step 1: Build the graph and in-degree dictionary
        for i, recipe in enumerate(recipes):
            graph[recipe] = graph.get(recipe, [])
            for x in ingredients[i]:
                graph[x] = graph.get(x, [])
                if recipe not in graph[x]:
                    graph[x].append(recipe)
                indegree[recipe] = indegree.get(recipe, 0) + 1
                indegree[x] = indegree.get(x, 0)

        # Step 2: Initialize the queue with supplies
        for node, degree in indegree.items():
            if degree == 0 and node in supplies:
                queue.append(node)

        # Step 3: Process the queue using BFS
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            if node in recipes:
                res.append(node)
            for nei in graph[node]:
                indegree[nei] -= 1
                if indegree[nei] == 0:
                    queue.append(nei)

        return res
```

### Approach 1: Breadth-First Search (BFS)

```python
class Solution:
    def findAllRecipes(
        self,
        recipes: list[str],
        ingredients: list[list[str]],
        supplies: list[str],
    ) -> list[str]:
        # Track available ingredients and recipes
        available = set(supplies)

        # Queue to process recipe indices
        recipe_queue = deque(range(len(recipes)))
        created_recipes = []
        last_size = -1  # Tracks last known available count

        # Continue while we keep finding new recipes
        while len(available) > last_size:
            last_size = len(available)
            queue_size = len(recipe_queue)

            # Process all recipes in current queue
            while queue_size > 0:
                queue_size -= 1
                recipe_idx = recipe_queue.popleft()
                if all(
                    ingredient in available
                    for ingredient in ingredients[recipe_idx]
                ):
                    # Recipe can be created - add to available items
                    available.add(recipes[recipe_idx])
                    created_recipes.append(recipes[recipe_idx])
                else:
                    recipe_queue.append(recipe_idx)

        return created_recipes
```

### Approach 2: Depth-First Search (DFS)

```python
class Solution:
    def findAllRecipes(
        self,
        recipes: list[str],
        ingredients: list[list[str]],
        supplies: list[str],
    ) -> list[str]:
        # Initialize tracking dictionaries using comprehensions
        can_make = dict.fromkeys(supplies, True)
        recipe_to_idx = {recipe: idx for idx, recipe in enumerate(recipes)}

        def _check_recipe(recipe: str, visited: set) -> bool:
            # Already processed and can be made
            if can_make.get(recipe, False):
                return True

            # Not a valid recipe or cycle detected
            if recipe not in recipe_to_idx or recipe in visited:
                return False

            visited.add(recipe)

            # Check if all ingredients can be made
            can_make[recipe] = all(
                _check_recipe(ingredient, visited)
                for ingredient in ingredients[recipe_to_idx[recipe]]
            )

            return can_make[recipe]

        # Process each recipe and collect those that can be made
        return [recipe for recipe in recipes if _check_recipe(recipe, set())]
```

### Approach 3: Topological Sort (Kahn's Algorithm)

```python
class Solution:
    def findAllRecipes(
        self,
        recipes: list[str],
        ingredients: list[list[str]],
        supplies: list[str],
    ) -> list[str]:
        # Store available supplies
        available_supplies = set(supplies)
        # Map recipe to its index
        recipe_to_index = {recipe: idx for idx, recipe in enumerate(recipes)}
        # Map ingredient to recipes that need it
        dependency_graph = defaultdict(list)
        # Count of non-supply ingredients needed for each recipe
        in_degree = [0] * len(recipes)

        # Build dependency graph
        for recipe_idx, ingredient_list in enumerate(ingredients):
            for ingredient in ingredient_list:
                if ingredient not in available_supplies:
                    dependency_graph[ingredient].append(recipes[recipe_idx])
                    in_degree[recipe_idx] += 1

        # Start with recipes that only need supplies
        queue = deque(idx for idx, count in enumerate(in_degree) if count == 0)
        created_recipes = []

        # Process recipes in topological order
        while queue:
            recipe_idx = queue.popleft()
            recipe = recipes[recipe_idx]
            created_recipes.append(recipe)

            # Skip if no recipes depend on this one
            for dependent_recipe in dependency_graph[recipe]:
                in_degree[recipe_to_index[dependent_recipe]] -= 1
                if in_degree[recipe_to_index[dependent_recipe]] == 0:
                    queue.append(recipe_to_index[dependent_recipe])

        return created_recipes
```
