I want to create a reading habit so that I can improve my reading skill as well as writing skill. One thing I realized that I am lacking is the vocabulary. I have read many English books and attempted to increase my vocab this way, but it turned out that I slightly read a bit faster than I was before. I want to see the huge improvement with this year. So, I try to do an experiment for myself and try to figure out how to improve my habit and practice reading from there.

First thing first, I want to take this time to write the plan that can be doable and help me to achieve my goal in both short-term and long-term. My plan is to read every day 1 hour at least and while reading I want to jot down any words or vocabulary that I don't understand. This way I think it could help me to learn and understand the the word better. Before, whenever I encountered the new words that I couldn't understand, I used my phone that has the dictionary app and looked up the word right away. This method helped me know the meaning of the word and understand the context that the author or writer try to explain at that moment, but soon I keep forgetting the same words over and over again. This is because I do not use them that often. With that said, in order to solve this problem, I would like to change the way I have done things and used the different approach which is write down the words that I don't know into a journal or post. Then, I plan to look up it later and write a sentence that use those words.

In addition, I want to keep track of my progress by planning the book that I want to read in this year or month. I want to layout the book that I have read and summarize what I have learned from the books. This way I could test if I am truly comprehend the main ideas or the thoughts that the authors try to convey to me.

Here are the table contains the books that I have read last year, I may need to re-read them later for better understand or entertain and the books that I plan to read this month or year.
