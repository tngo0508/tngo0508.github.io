## Problem Statement

[leetcode problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-players-with-zero-or-one-losses/description/)

## My Solution [Accepted]

```python
class Solution:
    def findWinners(self, matches: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = [[], []]
        winner_cnt = Counter()
        loser_cnt = Counter()
        for winner, loser in matches:
            winner_cnt[winner] += 1
            loser_cnt[loser] -= 1
            if loser in winner_cnt:
                del winner_cnt[loser]
            if winner in loser_cnt:
                del winner_cnt[winner]


        res[0] = sorted(list(winner_cnt.keys()))
        res[1] = sorted([player for player, cnt in loser_cnt.items() if cnt == -1])

        return res
```

### Approach 1: Hash Set

```python
class Solution:
    def findWinners(self, matches: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        zero_loss = set()
        one_loss = set()
        more_losses = set()

        for winner, loser in matches:
            # Add winner
            if (winner not in one_loss) and (winner not in more_losses):
                zero_loss.add(winner)
            # Add or move loser.
            if loser in zero_loss:
                zero_loss.remove(loser)
                one_loss.add(loser)
            elif loser in one_loss:
                one_loss.remove(loser)
                more_losses.add(loser)
            elif loser in more_losses:
                continue
            else:
                one_loss.add(loser)

        return [sorted(list(zero_loss)), sorted(list(one_loss))]
```

### Approach 2: Hash Set + Hash Map

```python
class Solution:
    def findWinners(self, matches : List[List[int]]) ->List[List[int]]:
        seen = set() losses_count = {}

        for winner, loser in matches:
            seen.add(winner)
            seen.add(loser)
            losses_count[loser] = losses_count.get(loser, 0) + 1

        # Add players with 0 or 1 loss to the corresponding list.
        zero_lose, one_lose = [], []
        for player in seen:
            count = losses_count.get(player, 0)
            if count == 0:
                zero_lose.append(player)
            elif count == 1:
                one_lose.append(player)

        return [sorted(zero_lose), sorted(one_lose)]
```
