## Problem Statement

![problem-959](/assets/images/2024-08-10_11-32-29-problem-959.png)

Notes:

- This is difficult medium problem. Need to review.
- Can review the Number of Island problem to solve using DFS/BFS

## Intuition

The problem can be visualized as splitting each cell of the grid into smaller parts based on the slashes. We can think of each cell as having four parts and depending on the slash, we will connect certain parts within the cell or with adjacent cells. The DSU (Disjoint Set Union) structure is a natural fit for managing these connections and counting the number of regions.

## Approach

1. Treat each cell in the grid as divided into four triangles.
2. Use a DSU to manage these triangles.
3. For each cell, depending on the slash or space, connect the appropriate triangles.
4. Also, connect triangles between adjacent cells to form the regions.
5. Finally, count the number of distinct regions by counting the number of unique sets in the DSU.

## Complexity

- Time complexity:
  The time complexity is $$O(N^2)$$ where `N` is the size of the grid. This is because we process each cell and perform union-find operations which are almost constant in time due to path compression.

- Space complexity:
  The space complexity is also $$O(N^2)$$ because we are using a DSU structure to store the parent of each part of each cell.

## Code

```python
class DSU:
    def __init__(self, N):
        self.p = list(range(N))

    def find(self, x):
        if self.p[x] != x:
            self.p[x] = self.find(self.p[x])
        return self.p[x]

    def union(self, x, y):
        xr = self.find(x)
        yr = self.find(y)
        self.p[xr] = yr

class Solution(object):
    def regionsBySlashes(self, grid):
        N = len(grid)
        dsu = DSU(4 * N * N)
        for r, row in enumerate(grid):
            for c, val in enumerate(row):
                root = 4 * (r*N + c)
                if val in '/ ':
                    dsu.union(root + 0, root + 1)
                    dsu.union(root + 2, root + 3)
                if val in '\ ':
                    dsu.union(root + 0, root + 2)
                    dsu.union(root + 1, root + 3)

                # north/south
                if r+1 < N: dsu.union(root + 3, (root+4*N) + 0)
                if r-1 >= 0: dsu.union(root + 0, (root-4*N) + 3)
                # east/west
                if c+1 < N: dsu.union(root + 2, (root+4) + 1)
                if c-1 >= 0: dsu.union(root + 1, (root-4) + 2)

        return sum(dsu.find(x) == x for x in range(4*N*N))

```

### Approach 1: Expanded Grid

![example](/assets/images/2024-08-10_11-38-11-example.png)

```python
class Solution:

    # Directions for traversal: right, left, down, up
    DIRECTIONS = [
        (0, 1),
        (0, -1),
        (1, 0),
        (-1, 0),
    ]

    def regionsBySlashes(self, grid):
        grid_size = len(grid)
        # Create a 3x3 matrix for each cell in the original grid
        expanded_grid = [[0] * (grid_size * 3) for _ in range(grid_size * 3)]

        # Populate the expanded grid based on the original grid
        # 1 represents a barrier in the expanded grid
        for i in range(grid_size):
            for j in range(grid_size):
                base_row = i * 3
                base_col = j * 3
                # Check the character in the original grid
                if grid[i][j] == "\\":
                    # Mark diagonal for backslash
                    expanded_grid[base_row][base_col] = 1
                    expanded_grid[base_row + 1][base_col + 1] = 1
                    expanded_grid[base_row + 2][base_col + 2] = 1
                elif grid[i][j] == "/":
                    # Mark diagonal for forward slash
                    expanded_grid[base_row][base_col + 2] = 1
                    expanded_grid[base_row + 1][base_col + 1] = 1
                    expanded_grid[base_row + 2][base_col] = 1

        region_count = 0
        # Count regions using flood fill
        for i in range(grid_size * 3):
            for j in range(grid_size * 3):
                # If we find an unvisited cell (0), it's a new region
                if expanded_grid[i][j] == 0:
                    # Fill that region
                    self._flood_fill(expanded_grid, i, j)
                    region_count += 1

        return region_count

    # Flood fill algorithm to mark all cells in a region
    def _flood_fill(self, expanded_grid, row, col):
        queue = [(row, col)]
        expanded_grid[row][col] = 1

        while queue:
            current_cell = queue.pop(0)
            # Check all four directions from the current cell
            for direction in self.DIRECTIONS:
                new_row = direction[0] + current_cell[0]
                new_col = direction[1] + current_cell[1]
                # If the new cell is valid and unvisited, mark it and add to queue
                if self._is_valid_cell(expanded_grid, new_row, new_col):
                    expanded_grid[new_row][new_col] = 1
                    queue.append((new_row, new_col))

    # Check if a cell is within bounds and unvisited
    def _is_valid_cell(self, expanded_grid, row, col):
        n = len(expanded_grid)
        return (
            row >= 0
            and col >= 0
            and row < n
            and col < n
            and expanded_grid[row][col] == 0
        )
```

### Approach 2: Disjoint Set Union (Triangles)

The idea is to envision each cell divided into four triangles. Then use Disjoint Set Union (DSU) to solve the problem

```python
class Solution:
    def regionsBySlashes(self, grid: List[str]) -> int:
        grid_size = len(grid)
        total_triangles = grid_size * grid_size * 4
        parent_array = [-1] * total_triangles

        # Initially, each small triangle is a separate region
        region_count = total_triangles

        for row in range(grid_size):
            for col in range(grid_size):
                # Connect with the cell above
                if row > 0:
                    region_count -= self._union_triangles(
                        parent_array,
                        self._get_triangle_index(grid_size, row - 1, col, 2),
                        self._get_triangle_index(grid_size, row, col, 0),
                    )
                # Connect with the cell to the left
                if col > 0:
                    region_count -= self._union_triangles(
                        parent_array,
                        self._get_triangle_index(grid_size, row, col - 1, 1),
                        self._get_triangle_index(grid_size, row, col, 3),
                    )

                # If not '/', connect triangles 0-1 and 2-3
                if grid[row][col] != "/":
                    region_count -= self._union_triangles(
                        parent_array,
                        self._get_triangle_index(grid_size, row, col, 0),
                        self._get_triangle_index(grid_size, row, col, 1),
                    )
                    region_count -= self._union_triangles(
                        parent_array,
                        self._get_triangle_index(grid_size, row, col, 2),
                        self._get_triangle_index(grid_size, row, col, 3),
                    )

                # If not '\', connect triangles 0-3 and 1-2
                if grid[row][col] != "\\":
                    region_count -= self._union_triangles(
                        parent_array,
                        self._get_triangle_index(grid_size, row, col, 0),
                        self._get_triangle_index(grid_size, row, col, 3),
                    )
                    region_count -= self._union_triangles(
                        parent_array,
                        self._get_triangle_index(grid_size, row, col, 2),
                        self._get_triangle_index(grid_size, row, col, 1),
                    )

        return region_count

    # Calculate the index of a triangle in the flattened array
    # Each cell is divided into 4 triangles, numbered 0 to 3 clockwise from the top
    def _get_triangle_index(self, grid_size, row, col, triangle_num):
        return (grid_size * row + col) * 4 + triangle_num

    # Union two triangles and return 1 if they were not already connected, 0 otherwise
    def _union_triangles(self, parent_array, x, y):
        parent_x = self._find_parent(parent_array, x)
        parent_y = self._find_parent(parent_array, y)
        if parent_x != parent_y:
            parent_array[parent_x] = parent_y
            return 1  # Regions were merged, so count decreases by 1
        return 0  # Regions were already connected

    # Find the parent (root) of a set
    def _find_parent(self, parent_array, x):
        if parent_array[x] == -1:
            return x
        parent_array[x] = self._find_parent(parent_array, parent_array[x])
        return parent_array[x]
```
