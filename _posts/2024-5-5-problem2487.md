## Problem Statement

![problem-2487](/assets/images/2024-05-05_18-07-59-problem-2487.png)

## Intuition

Initially, I thought of utilizing a stack to traverse the linked list in reverse order, maintaining a resulting list with nodes that need to be kept based on the condition.

## Approach

My approach involves traversing the linked list in reverse order using a stack. I push each node onto the stack, then pop from the stack, adding nodes to the result list if they meet the condition of having a value greater than or equal to the previous node. Finally, I reconstruct the resulting list from the collected nodes.

## Complexity

- Time complexity:
  O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the linked list

- Space complexity:
  O(n)

## Code

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeNodes(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head:
            return

        stack = []
        curr = head
        while curr:
            stack.append(curr)
            curr = curr.next

        res = []
        while stack:
            curr = stack.pop()
            if not res or curr.val >= res[-1].val:
                res.append(curr)

        dummy = ListNode(-1)
        curr = dummy
        while res:
            curr.next = res.pop()
            curr = curr.next

        curr.next = None
        return dummy.next
```

## Editorial Solution

### Approach 1: Stack

```python
class Solution:
    def removeNodes(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        stack = []
        current = head

        # Add nodes to the stack
        while current:
            stack.append(current)
            current = current.next

        current = stack.pop()
        maximum = current.val
        result_list = ListNode(maximum)

        # Remove nodes from the stack and add to result
        while stack:
            current = stack.pop()
            # Current should not be added to the result
            if current.val < maximum:
                continue
            # Add new node with current's value to front of the result
            else:
                new_node = ListNode(current.val)
                new_node.next = result_list
                result_list = new_node
                maximum = current.val

        return result_list
```

### Approach 2: Recursion

```python
class Solution:
    def removeNodes(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # Base case, reached end of the list
        if head is None or head.next is None:
            return head

        # Recursive call
        next_node = self.removeNodes(head.next)

        # If the next node has greater value than head, delete the head
        # Return next node, which removes the current head and
        # makes next the new head
        if head.val < next_node.val:
            return next_node

        # Keep the head
        head.next = next_node
        return head
```
