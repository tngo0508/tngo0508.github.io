## Problem Statement

![problem](/assets/images/2025-04-04_17-30-23-problem-1123.jpg)

## Intuition

To find the **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of the deepest leaves** in a binary tree, we need to:

1. Determine how deep the deepest leaves go.
2. Collect all leaves at that deepest level.
3. Find the lowest node in the tree that is an ancestor to **all** of those deepest leaves.

## Approach

1. **Calculate the maximum depth** of the tree using a recursive function `find_depth`.

   - This function returns the depth of the deepest subtree by recursively exploring left and right branches.

2. **Collect all deepest leaves** using `find_deepest_leaves`.

   - Traverse the tree while tracking the current level.
   - When the current level matches the maximum depth, add the node to a list of deepest leaves.

3. **Find the LCA** of the deepest leaves:
   - If there is only one deepest leaf, it is its own ancestor â€” return it.
   - Otherwise, use a recursive `lca` function that checks whether each subtree contains one of the target leaves.
   - When two of the three flags (`left`, `right`, `mid`) are True, the current node is the LCA.
   - Save the LCA in `self.lca_node`.

## Complexity

- **Time complexity**:  
  $$O(n)$$  
  Each of the three main functions (`find_depth`, `find_deepest_leaves`, and `lca`) traverses the tree once.

- **Space complexity**:  
  $$O(h)$$  
  Where \( h \) is the height of the tree due to recursive stack space.

## Code

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def lcaDeepestLeaves(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        res = []
        depth = [0]

        def find_depth(node):
            if not node:
                return -1
            left = find_depth(node.left) + 1
            right = find_depth(node.right) + 1
            return max(left, right)

        def find_deepest_leaves(node, last_level, curr_level, leaves):
            if not node:
                return
            if curr_level == last_level:
                leaves.append(node)
                return
            find_deepest_leaves(node.left, last_level, curr_level + 1, leaves)
            find_deepest_leaves(node.right, last_level, curr_level + 1, leaves)

        def lca(node, p, q):
            if not node:
                return False

            left = lca(node.left, p, q)
            right = lca(node.right, p, q)
            mid = node is p or node is q
            if sum([left, right, mid]) >= 2:
                self.lca_node = node
            return left or right or mid

        deepest_level = find_depth(root)
        leaves = []
        find_deepest_leaves(root, deepest_level, 0, leaves)
        if len(leaves) == 1:
            return leaves[0]

        self.lca_node = root
        lca(root, leaves[0], leaves[-1])
        return self.lca_node
```

## Editorial

## Approach 1: Recursion

```python
class Solution:
    def lcaDeepestLeaves(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        def dfs(root):
            if not root:
                return 0, None

            left = dfs(root.left)
            right = dfs(root.right)

            if left[0] > right[0]:
                return left[0] + 1, left[1]
            if left[0] < right[0]:
                return right[0] + 1, right[1]
            return left[0] + 1, root

        return dfs(root)[1]
```
