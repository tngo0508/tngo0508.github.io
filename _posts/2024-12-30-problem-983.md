## Problem Statement

![problem](/assets/images/2024-12-30_18-26-58-problem-983.jpg)

## Intuition

When I first encountered this problem, I immediately recognized that it revolves around minimizing costs over a timeline of travel days. Since we have three different types of tickets (daily, weekly, and monthly), the challenge is essentially choosing the most cost-effective combination while covering all the given travel days. I noticed that this has the flavor of a dynamic programming problem due to overlapping subproblems and an optimal substructure.

## Approach

To solve this problem, I decided to use a recursive Depth-First Search (DFS) approach combined with memoization to store and reuse results of previously computed states.

Here's the plan:

1. **Sort the travel days**: Although not strictly necessary here, sorting helps conceptualize the problem more clearly.
2. **Use a set for quick lookups**: I used a set for the travel days to efficiently determine if a given day requires a ticket.
3. **Recursive DFS with memoization**: The recursion function attempts to calculate the minimum cost starting from any given day. If the current day is not a travel day, it skips to the next day without adding to the cost. Otherwise, it considers all three ticket options (daily, weekly, monthly) and takes the minimum of these costs.

### Key Details:

- **Base Case**: If the start day exceeds the last travel day, the recursion returns the accumulated cost as no further tickets are needed.
- **Memoization**: To avoid redundant computations, I stored results of subproblems in a dictionary using `(start, curr_cost)` as the key.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:  
  The complexity is approximately $$O(n \cdot d)$$, where $$n$$ is the number of days in the travel list, and $$d$$ is the maximum gap between travel days. This is because the recursion runs for each travel day and explores at most 3 options per recursive step.
- **Space Complexity**:  
  $$O(n)$$ for the memoization dictionary and the recursion stack.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def mincostTickets(self, days: List[int], costs: List[int]) -> int:
        res = float('inf')
        days.sort()
        travel_days = set(days)
        last_day = max(days)

        def dfs(start, curr_cost):
            if start > last_day:
                return curr_cost

            if start not in travel_days:
                return dfs(start + 1, curr_cost)

            if (start, curr_cost) in memo:
                return memo[(start, curr_cost)]

            ans = float('inf')
            ans = min(ans, dfs(start + 1, curr_cost + costs[0]))
            ans = min(ans, dfs(start + 7, curr_cost + costs[1]))
            ans = min(ans, dfs(start + 30, curr_cost + costs[2]))
            memo[(start, curr_cost)] = ans
            return ans

        memo = defaultdict(int)
        return dfs(0, 0)
```

## Editorial

### Approach 1: Top-Down Dynamic Programming

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    unordered_set<int> isTravelNeeded;

    int solve(vector<int>& dp, vector<int>& days, vector<int>& costs, int currDay) {
        // If we have iterated over travel days, return 0.
        if (currDay > days[days.size() - 1]) {
            return 0;
        }

        // If we don't need to travel on this day, move on to next day.
        if (isTravelNeeded.find(currDay) == isTravelNeeded.end()) {
            return solve(dp, days, costs, currDay + 1);
        }

        // If already calculated, return from here with the stored answer.
        if (dp[currDay] != -1) {
            return dp[currDay];
        }

        int oneDay = costs[0] + solve(dp, days, costs, currDay + 1);
        int sevenDay = costs[1] + solve(dp, days, costs, currDay + 7);
        int thirtyDay = costs[2] + solve(dp, days, costs, currDay + 30);

        // Store the cost with the minimum of the three options.
        return dp[currDay] = min(oneDay, min(sevenDay, thirtyDay));
    }

    int mincostTickets(vector<int>& days, vector<int>& costs) {
        // The last day on which we need to travel.
        int lastDay = days[days.size() - 1];
        vector<int> dp(lastDay + 1, -1);

        // Mark the days on which we need to travel.
        for (int day : days) {
            isTravelNeeded.insert(day);
        }

        return solve(dp, days, costs, 1);
    }
};
```

### Approach 2: Bottom-up Dynamic Programming

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int mincostTickets(vector<int>& days, vector<int>& costs) {
        int lastDay = days[days.size() - 1];
        vector<int> dp(lastDay + 1, 0);

        int i = 0;
        for (int day = 1; day <= lastDay; day++) {
            if (day < days[i]) {
                dp[day] = dp[day - 1];
            } else {
                i++;
                dp[day] = min({dp[day - 1] + costs[0],
                               dp[max(0, day - 7)] + costs[1],
                               dp[max(0, day - 30)] + costs[2]});
            }
        }

        return dp[lastDay];
    }
};
```
