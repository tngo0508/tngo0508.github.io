## Problem Statement

[![problem-392](/assets/images/2024-02-15_15-37-54-problem-392.png)](/assets/images/2024-02-15_15-37-54-problem-392.png)

## Intuition

My initial thought is to iterate through the characters of `t` and check if each character matches the corresponding character in `s`. If I find a match, I can then iterate through the remaining characters of both strings to see if the entire `s` is present as a subsequence in `t`.

## Approach

I will iterate through each character of `t`, and when I find a character that matches the first character of `s`, I will initiate a nested loop to compare the subsequent characters of both strings. If I successfully match all characters of `s` in order, then I can conclude that `s` is a subsequence of `t`.

## Complexity

- Time complexity:
O(m \* n), where m is the length of `s` and n is the length of `t`. This is because in the worst case, I may need to traverse through all characters of `t` for each character in `s`.

- Space complexity:
O(1) as I am not using any additional data structures that scale with the input size.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if not s:
            return True
        for i, c in enumerate(t):
            if s and c == s[0]:
                idx_t = i
                idx_s = 0
                while idx_t < len(t):
                    if t[idx_t] == s[idx_s]:
                        idx_s += 1
                    idx_t += 1
                    if idx_s == len(s):
                        return True
        
        return False

```

## Another Approach: buckets

This approach uses a dictionary to create "buckets" for each character in the second string, `t`. These buckets contain the indices where each character occurs in `t`.

Then, it iterates through the characters of the first string, `s`, in reverse order. For each character, it checks if there is a corresponding bucket in `t`. If so, it pops the last index from that bucket and ensures it is in a valid order relative to the previous character's index.

If the indices are not in the correct order or the character is not present in `t`, the function returns `False`. If all characters are processed successfully, it returns `True`, indicating that `s` is a subsequence of `t`.

```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        buckets = defaultdict(list)
        for i, c in enumerate(t):
            buckets[c].append(i)

        idx = len(t)
        for c in reversed(s):
            if c not in buckets:
                return False

            while buckets and c in buckets and buckets[c]:
                i = buckets[c].pop()
                if i < idx:
                    idx = i
                    break
                else:
                    return False
                
            if not buckets[c]:
                del buckets[c]
        
        return True
```

## Editorial Solution

### Approach 2: Two-Pointers

```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        LEFT_BOUND, RIGHT_BOUND = len(s), len(t)

        p_left = p_right = 0
        while p_left < LEFT_BOUND and p_right < RIGHT_BOUND:
            # move both pointers or just the right pointer
            if s[p_left] == t[p_right]:
                p_left += 1
            p_right += 1

        return p_left == LEFT_BOUND
```
