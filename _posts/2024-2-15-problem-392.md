## Problem Statement

[![problem-392](/assets/images/2024-02-15_15-37-54-problem-392.png)](/assets/images/2024-02-15_15-37-54-problem-392.png)

## Intuition

My initial thought is to iterate through the characters of `t` and check if each character matches the corresponding character in `s`. If I find a match, I can then iterate through the remaining characters of both strings to see if the entire `s` is present as a subsequence in `t`.

## Approach

I will iterate through each character of `t`, and when I find a character that matches the first character of `s`, I will initiate a nested loop to compare the subsequent characters of both strings. If I successfully match all characters of `s` in order, then I can conclude that `s` is a subsequence of `t`.

## Complexity

- Time complexity:
O(m \* n), where m is the length of `s` and n is the length of `t`. This is because in the worst case, I may need to traverse through all characters of `t` for each character in `s`.

- Space complexity:
O(1) as I am not using any additional data structures that scale with the input size.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if not s:
            return True
        for i, c in enumerate(t):
            if s and c == s[0]:
                idx_t = i
                idx_s = 0
                while idx_t < len(t):
                    if t[idx_t] == s[idx_s]:
                        idx_s += 1
                    idx_t += 1
                    if idx_s == len(s):
                        return True
        
        return False

```
