# Problem Statement
```
Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9

```

# Intuition
The problem involves finding the length of the longest consecutive sequence in an unsorted array of integers. My initial thought is to use a set to efficiently check for the presence of numbers and explore consecutive sequences.

# Approach
I plan to iterate through the numbers in the array and, for each unvisited number, extend a consecutive sequence by incrementing and decrementing until no more consecutive numbers are found. I will keep track of the visited numbers to avoid redundant processing. The length of each consecutive sequence will be compared to the current maximum length.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array. The algorithm iterates through each element once.

- Space complexity:
O(n), as the set "seen" stores the visited numbers.

# Code
```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        set_nums = set(nums)
        seen = set()
        res = 0
        for num in nums:
            if num not in seen:
                lo, hi = num, num
                while num + 1 in set_nums:
                    hi = num + 1
                    num += 1
                    seen.add(hi)
                while num - 1 in set_nums:
                    lo = num - 1
                    num -= 1
                    seen.add(lo)
                res = max(res, hi - lo + 1)
                seen.add(num)
        return res
        
```

# Union-Find Approach
```python
# Helper class for making connected components 
class UnionFind:
    # Constructor
    def __init__(self, nums):
        self.parent = {num: num for num in nums}
        self.size = {num: 1 for num in nums}
        self.max_length = 1

    # Function to find the root of a sequence to which num1 belongs
    def find(self, num):
        if self.parent[num] != num:
            self.parent[num] = self.find(self.parent[num])
        return self.parent[num]

    # Function to merge the two sequences and updating lengths
    def union(self, num1, num2):
        x_root = self.find(num1)
        y_root = self.find(num2)
        if x_root != y_root:
            if self.size[x_root] < self.size[y_root]:
                x_root, y_root = y_root, x_root
            self.parent[y_root] = x_root
            self.size[x_root] += self.size[y_root]
            self.max_length = max(self.max_length, self.size[x_root])

from union_find import UnionFind

def longest_consecutive_sequence(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    uf = UnionFind(nums)
    for num in nums:
        if num + 1 in nums:
            uf.union(num, num + 1)
    
    return uf.max_length
```

Explanation:
The provided code implements the `Union-Find` data structure to find the length of the longest consecutive sequence in an array of numbers. The `Union-Find` class maintains parent and size information for each number. The find function identifies the root of a sequence, and the union function merges two sequences while updating their lengths. The `longest_consecutive_sequence` function creates a `Union-Find` instance and iterates through the numbers, performing unions for consecutive elements. The maximum length of any merged sequence is tracked and returned as the result.

# Editorial Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums):
        longest_streak = 0
        num_set = set(nums)

        for num in num_set:
            if num - 1 not in num_set:
                current_num = num
                current_streak = 1

                while current_num + 1 in num_set:
                    current_num += 1
                    current_streak += 1

                longest_streak = max(longest_streak, current_streak)

        return longest_streak
```
