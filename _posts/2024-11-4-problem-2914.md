## Problem Statement

![problem](/assets/images/2024-11-04_19-52-38-problem-2914.png)

## Intuition

The problem involves finding the minimum number of changes required to make certain conditions meet within a string. My first intuition was to iterate through the string in pairs to detect mismatches between adjacent characters. For each mismatch, I would increment a counter to track the number of changes required.

## Approach

To solve this problem:

1. Start by calculating the length of the string.
2. Initialize a result variable (`res`) to count the number of required changes.
3. Loop through the string with a step of 2 to handle pairs of characters at positions `i` and `i+1`.
4. For each pair, if the characters at `i` and `i+1` are different, increment the counter `res` by one, since we need to change one of them to make the pair identical.
5. Finally, return `res` as the total number of changes required.

This approach allows us to efficiently count the required changes in a single pass through the string.

## Complexity

- **Time complexity**: $$O(n)$$, where \(n\) is the length of the string. This is because we are iterating through the string once, checking pairs in constant time.
- **Space complexity**: $$O(1)$$, as we are only using a fixed amount of extra space for the counter.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def minChanges(self, s: str) -> int:
        N = len(s)
        res = 0
        for i in range(0, N - 1, 2):  # Ensuring we don't go out of bounds
            if s[i] != s[i + 1]:
                res += 1
        return res
```

## Editorial

## Approach 1: Greedy

```python
class Solution:
    def minChanges(self, s: str) -> int:
        # Initialize with first character
        current_char = s[0]

        consecutive_count = 0
        min_changes_required = 0

        # Iterate through each character
        for char in s:
            # If current character matches the previous sequence
            if char == current_char:
                consecutive_count += 1
                continue

            # If we have even count of characters, start new sequence
            if consecutive_count % 2 == 0:
                consecutive_count = 1
            # If odd count, we need to change current character
            else:
                consecutive_count = 0
                min_changes_required += 1

            # Update current character for next iteration
            current_char = char

        return min_changes_required
```

## Approach 2: Greedy (Optimized)

```python
class Solution:
    def minChanges(self, s: str) -> int:
        min_changes_required = 0

        # Check pairs of characters (i, i+1) with step size 2
        for i in range(0, len(s), 2):
            # If characters in current pair don't match,
            # we need one change to make them equal
            if s[i] != s[i + 1]:
                min_changes_required += 1
        return min_changes_required


"""
pythonic one liner:

class Solution:
    def minChanges(self, s: str) -> int:
        # Count changes needed for each unmatched pair
        return sum(s[i] != s[i + 1] for i in range(0, len(s), 2))
"""
