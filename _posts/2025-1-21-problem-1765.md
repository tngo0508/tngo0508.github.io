## Problem Statement

![problem](/assets/images/2025-01-21_20-02-52-problem-1765.jpg)

## BFS Approach [Accepted]

```python
class Solution:
    def highestPeak(self, isWater: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        queue = deque()
        ROWS = len(isWater)
        COLS = len(isWater[0])
        set_cells = set()
        for row in range(ROWS):
            for col in range(COLS):
                if isWater[row][col] == 1:
                    isWater[row][col] = 0
                    queue.append([row, col])
                    set_cells.add((row, col))

        h = 1

        while queue:
            n = len(queue)
            for _ in range(n):
                r, c = queue.popleft()
                for x, y in [(0,1),(1,0),(-1,0),(0,-1)]:
                    nr, nc = r + x, c + y
                    if 0 <= nr < ROWS and 0 <= nc < COLS and (nr, nc) not in set_cells:
                        isWater[nr][nc] = h
                        set_cells.add((nr, nc))
                        queue.append([nr, nc])
            h += 1
        return isWater
```

### Approach 1: Breadth-first search

```python
class Solution:
    def highestPeak(self, is_water):
        dx = [0, 0, 1, -1]  # Horizontal movement: right, left, down, up
        dy = [1, -1, 0, 0]  # Vertical movement corresponding to dx

        rows = len(is_water)
        columns = len(is_water[0])

        # Initialize the height matrix with -1 (unprocessed cells)
        cell_heights = [[-1 for _ in range(columns)] for _ in range(rows)]

        # Queue to perform breadth-first search
        cell_queue = deque()

        # Add all water cells to the queue and set their height to 0
        for x in range(rows):
            for y in range(columns):
                if is_water[x][y] == 1:
                    cell_queue.append((x, y))
                    cell_heights[x][y] = 0

        # Initial height for land cells adjacent to water
        height_of_next_layer = 1

        # Perform BFS
        while cell_queue:
            layer_size = len(cell_queue)

            # Iterate through all cells in the current layer
            for _ in range(layer_size):
                current_cell = cell_queue.popleft()

                # Check all four possible directions for neighboring cells
                for d in range(4):
                    neighbor_x = current_cell[0] + dx[d]
                    neighbor_y = current_cell[1] + dy[d]

                    # Check if the neighbor is valid and unprocessed
                    if (
                        self._is_valid_cell(
                            neighbor_x, neighbor_y, rows, columns
                        )
                        and cell_heights[neighbor_x][neighbor_y] == -1
                    ):
                        cell_heights[neighbor_x][
                            neighbor_y
                        ] = height_of_next_layer
                        cell_queue.append((neighbor_x, neighbor_y))

            height_of_next_layer += 1  # Increment height for the next layer

        return cell_heights

    def _is_valid_cell(self, x, y, rows, columns):
        """Check if a cell is within the grid boundaries."""
        return 0 <= x < rows and 0 <= y < columns
```

```python

        # Initialize the cellHeights matrix with INF (unprocessed cells)
        cell_heights = [[INF] * columns for _ in range(rows)]

        # Set the height of water cells to 0
        for row in range(rows):
            for col in range(columns):
                if is_water[row][col] == 1:
                    cell_heights[row][col] = 0  # Water cells have height 0

        # Forward pass: updating heights based on top and left neighbors
