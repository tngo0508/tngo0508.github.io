## Problem Statement

## Intuition

The problem is to find the next greater element for each element in a circular array. The first thought is to use a stack to maintain a decreasing sequence of indices corresponding to elements. This allows efficient determination of the next greater element as we traverse the array.

In a circular array, we need to iterate beyond the array's bounds to ensure each element has a chance to check for a greater element that might wrap around. This can be achieved by traversing the array twice using modular arithmetic.

## Approach

1. **Initialize Variables**:

   - `res`: An array initialized with `-1` to store results.
   - `stack`: A stack to store indices of elements in the array.
   - Traverse the array twice (using `2 * N - 1` iterations).

2. **Iterate in Reverse**:

   - Use the modulo operator (`i % N`) to handle the circular nature of the array.
   - For each element:
     - Remove indices from the stack whose corresponding values are less than or equal to the current element (`nums[index]`).
     - If the stack is not empty, the top of the stack gives the next greater element.
     - Otherwise, the result remains `-1`.

3. **Update the Stack**:

   - Add the current index to the stack to maintain the decreasing sequence.

4. **Return Result**:
   - After processing all elements, return the `res` array containing the next greater elements.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:  
  $$O(n)$$  
  Each element is pushed onto the stack once and popped at most once. Since we iterate through the array twice, the overall complexity is linear relative to the array size.

- **Space Complexity**:  
  $$O(n)$$  
  The stack can hold up to `n` indices in the worst case.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def nextGreaterElements(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        N = len(nums)
        stack = []
        res = [-1] * N
        for i in range(2 * N - 1, -1, -1):
            index = i % N
            while stack and nums[stack[-1]] <= nums[index]:
                stack.pop()
            if stack:
                res[index] = nums[stack[-1]]
            else:
                res[index] = -1

            stack.append(index)
        return res
```
