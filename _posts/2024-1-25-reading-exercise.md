# My take on the reading
Today, I continued reading the Mindset book by Carol. S. Dweck. In this chapter, I have learned that the artistic ability can be learnable. It's true that some people could be more gifted than other, but that did not tell us that people could not gain the ability or skill that they desired. I used to have a discussion with an acquaintence about this topic. During that time, that person argued people with artistic skills are natural and asked me if I think I could draw or came up the amazing art. At that time, I believed that people could change their ability and skill gradually with efforts. However, the acquaintence did not believe so and we got into a heated arguments about this topic. Now, after reading throught this chapter, it ensured me that my belief was in fact correct. I think the acquaintence that I used know has a short sighted and he is quite presumpteous. I think he just doesn't know or understand the components - the learnable components - of drawing yet. I personally and strongly believe that everyone could improve their ability and intelligence over time. "Just because some people can do something with little or no training, it doesn't mean that other can't do it (and somethimes do it even better) with training" by Dr. Dweck. Very wise word indeed.

In addition, I also learned that we ought not to praise our children for their ability, but we are better off praising them for their effort. Doing so we actually provide them the potential to grow and unlock the next level of achievements. In the book, the author used the term positive and negative labels and explain how it works. Basically, the idea is that if we give too much positive labels to anyone, they would take it as their precious talent and protect it at all costs. Since, they are labeld positive or gifted or talented people, they are unconsciously put into a defensive mode where they were no longer immuned to criticism or constructive feedback. These are the people with fixed mindset, they feel ashamed as if they failed something after receiving so many positive praise about their ability. They would think that they are not smart enough after the failure and less-than-success meant they were deficient. Otherwise, people with growth mindset have no limit on their growth. People who received the praise based on their effort actually excel a lot better because they think of failure as an opportunity to grow. And that more difficulties mean that they need to apply more effort or try new strategies to achieve whatever they are aiming at.

In short, if we have a growth mindset, we would use the negative labels to develop our minds differently. We will not be filled with limiting thoughts, fragile sense of belonging, and belief that other can dictate on us.
