# My take on the reading
Today, I delved further into Carol S. Dweck's "Mindset" book, focusing on a chapter that resonated with me about the learnability of artistic ability. The chapter highlighted that while some individuals may seem more naturally gifted, artistic skills are indeed acquireable through effort and learning. This concept brought to mind a past discussion where someone questioned my belief that people could develop artistic skills with dedication.

Upon reflection, I now feel validated in my perspective after reading this chapter. It reinforced my belief that abilities and skills are malleable and can be improved over time with consistent effort. The individual I once debated with may have had a limited view, lacking an understanding of the learnable components of artistic skills.

Furthermore, the chapter emphasized the importance of praising effort over inherent ability. Positive labels, when overly used, can create a fixed mindset, where individuals become defensive and resistant to criticism. On the other hand, a growth mindset embraces challenges and failures as opportunities for growth. This resonated with me, as I have observed the impact of praising effort in fostering resilience and a passion for learning.

In essence, the chapter underscored the power of a growth mindset, where negative labels can be catalysts for personal development. A growth mindset liberates individuals from limiting thoughts and empowers them to embrace challenges as avenues for growth, fostering a resilient and adaptable mindset.
