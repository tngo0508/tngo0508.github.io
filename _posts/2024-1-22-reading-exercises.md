# My Daily Reading
From tonight's reading, I've learned that our mindset can affect how we see effort. In a fixed mindset, we might look down on people who spend a lot of time on something, thinking they lack natural talent or genius. This view is short-sighted. With a growth mindset, we appreciate effort more. Regardless of our abilities, effort is what sparks those abilities and turns them into achievements, as mentioned by Carol S. Dweck.
