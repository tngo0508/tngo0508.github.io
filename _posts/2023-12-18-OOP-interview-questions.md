In this journal, I want to review and layout the common questions for OOP topic in an interview.
# What is object-oriented programming, and why is it beneficial in ASP.NET development?
Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which encapsulate data and behavior. In ASP.NET, OOP promotes code reusability, maintainability, and scalability by structuring applications around classes and objects.
# Explain the four pillars of OOP (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction) and how they apply to ASP.NET.
## Encapsulation: 
Bundling data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit (class). In ASP.NET, encapsulation is crucial for creating modular and secure components.
## Inheritance: 
Deriving new classes from existing ones to reuse and extend functionality. In ASP.NET, this helps in creating a hierarchy of classes for code organization.
## Polymorphism: 
Providing a single interface for different types of objects. In ASP.NET, this can be seen in method overloading, interfaces, and abstract classes.
## Abstraction: 
Simplifying complex systems by modeling classes appropriate to the problem, and working at the most relevant level of inheritance. In ASP.NET, abstraction helps in creating generic and reusable components.
# How do you create and use a class in C#? Provide an example.
In C#, you define a class using the class keyword. Here's an example:
```csharp
public class Car
{
    public string Model { get; set; }
    public int Year { get; set; }
}

```
You can then create an object of the class:
```csharp
Car myCar = new Car();
myCar.Model = "Toyota";
myCar.Year = 2022;

```
# Explain the concept of constructors in C# and how they are used in ASP.NET.
Constructors are special methods in a class used for initializing objects. In ASP.NET, constructors are often used to set up initial states, establish database connections, or perform other necessary setup tasks when an object is created.

# How does inheritance work in C#? Provide an example related to ASP.NET.
Inheritance in C# allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. For example, in ASP.NET, you might have a base class Page and then create specific page classes that inherit from it.
```csharp
public class BasePage : Page
{
    // Common functionality for all pages
}

public class HomePage : BasePage
{
    // Additional functionality specific to the home page
}

```
# Explain the concept of polymorphism in ASP.NET C#.
Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type. In ASP.NET, polymorphism is often achieved through method overloading or interfaces, enabling flexibility in handling different types of objects.
