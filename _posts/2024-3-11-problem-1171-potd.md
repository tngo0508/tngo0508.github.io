## Problem Statement

[![problem-1171](/assets/images/2024-03-11_18-10-05-problem-1171.png)](/assets/images/2024-03-11_18-10-05-problem-1171.png)

## Intuition

The problem involves removing zero-sum sublists from a linked list. Use `stack` and `hash set` data structure to solve the problem.

## Approach

I approach the problem by using a `stack` to maintain the running sum of nodes in the linked list along with the corresponding node. I also use a set (`prefix_sum`) to keep track of the unique running sums encountered. While iterating through the linked list, if the running sum is already in the set, I remove the subsequence with a zero sum. Finally, I connect the remaining nodes in the stack to form the modified linked list.

## Complexity

- Time complexity:
  O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. The algorithm iterates through the list once.

- Space complexity:
  O(n), as the space required for the stack and set is proportional to the number of nodes in the linked list.

## Code

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeZeroSumSublists(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = ListNode(-1)
        stack = [[dummy, 0]]
        curr = head
        prefix_sum = {0}
        while curr:
            _, total = stack[-1]
            total += curr.val
            if total in prefix_sum:
                seen = total
                while stack and stack[-1][1] != seen:
                    _, total = stack.pop()
                    prefix_sum.remove(total)
            else:
                stack.append([curr, total])
                prefix_sum.add(total)
            curr = curr.next

        for i in range(len(stack) - 1):
            stack[i][0].next = stack[i + 1][0]

        stack[-1][0].next = None

        return stack[0][0].next
```
