## Problem Statement

![problem](/assets/images/2025-01-14_20-41-16-problem-2429.jpg)

## Intuition

The problem is to construct a number that has the same number of set bits (1s) as `num2`, while minimizing the XOR result with `num1`.

The key observation is that XOR minimizes when the constructed number (`res`) has its bits as close as possible to `num1`. To achieve this, prioritize setting the most significant bits of `num1` in `res` while respecting the number of set bits required.

## Approach

1. **Count the set bits in `num2`:**

   - Use bitwise operations to calculate the number of 1s in `num2` (`set_bit`).

2. **Identify the leftmost bit position in `num1`:**

   - Iterate through the bits of `num1` to find its most significant bit.

3. **Construct the result:**

   - Start with `res = 0` and try to set bits in `res` from most significant to least significant:
     - Use the bits of `num1` when they are set.
     - Stop setting bits from `num1` when the required number of set bits (`set_bit`) is satisfied.
   - If additional bits need to be set after using all possible bits from `num1`, set the least significant bits in `res`.

4. **Return the result:**
   - The constructed number (`res`) minimizes the XOR value with `num1` and satisfies the set bit condition.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**  
  $$O(\log(\text{max}(num1, num2)))$$

  - Counting set bits and iterating through bits of `num1` are logarithmic in the value of the number.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  $$O(1)$$
  - No additional data structures are used; the space usage is constant.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def minimizeXor(self, num1: int, num2: int) -> int:
        res = 0
        set_bit = 0
        x, y = num1, num2

        # Count the number of set bits in num2
        while y > 0:
            set_bit += (y & 1)
            y = y >> 1

        # Find the leftmost bit of num1
        left_most_bit_num1 = 1
        while x > 1:
            x = x >> 1
            left_most_bit_num1 = left_most_bit_num1 << 1

        # Set bits in res using num1's bits
        res = 0
        while set_bit > 0 and left_most_bit_num1 > 0:
            if left_most_bit_num1 & num1 == left_most_bit_num1:
                res = res | left_most_bit_num1
                set_bit -= 1
            left_most_bit_num1 = left_most_bit_num1 >> 1

        # Set remaining bits from the least significant position
        curr = 1
        while set_bit > 0:
            if res & curr != curr:
                res = res | curr
                set_bit -= 1
            curr = curr << 1

        return res
```

## Editorial

### Trick

```
To check if the i-th bit of num is set:

Shift 1 left by i (1 << i) positions to isolate the i-th bit.
Perform a bitwise AND: num & (1 << i).
If the result is not 0, the i-th bit of num is set.

----------------------------------------------------------

To set the i-th bit of num:

Shift 1 left by i (1 << i) positions to isolate the i-th bit.
Perfom a bitwise OR: num | (1 << i).

----------------------------------------------------------

To unset the i-th bit of num:

Shift 1 left by i (1 << i) positions to create a mask.
Invert the mask using ~(1 << i) to make the i-th bit 1 and all the other bits 0.
Perform a bitwise AND: num & ~(1 << i).

```

### Approach 1: From Optimal to Valid

```python
class Solution:
    def minimizeXor(self, num1: int, num2: int) -> int:
        # Initialize result to num1. We will modify result.
        result = num1

        target_set_bits_count = bin(num2).count("1")
        set_bits_count = bin(result).count("1")

        # Start with the least significant bit (bit 0).
        current_bit = 0

        # Add bits to result if it has fewer set bits than the target.
        while set_bits_count < target_set_bits_count:
            # If the current bit in result is not set (0), set it to 1.
            if not self._is_set(result, current_bit):
                result = self._set_bit(result, current_bit)
                set_bits_count += 1
            # Move to the next bit.
            current_bit += 1

        # Remove bits from result if it has more set bits than the target.
        while set_bits_count > target_set_bits_count:
            # If the current bit in result is set (1), unset it (make it 0).
            if self._is_set(result, current_bit):
                result = self._unset_bit(result, current_bit)
                set_bits_count -= 1
            # Move to the next bit.
            current_bit += 1

        return result

    # Helper function to check if the given bit position in result is set (1).
    def _is_set(self, x: int, bit: int) -> bool:
        return (x & (1 << bit)) != 0

    # Helper function to set the given bit position in result to 1.
    def _set_bit(self, x: int, bit: int):
        return x | (1 << bit)

    # Helper function to unset the given bit position in x (set it to 0).
    def _unset_bit(self, x: int, bit: int):
        return x & ~(1 << bit)
```
