## Problem Statement

[leetcode problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-ii/description/)

## Memoization [Accepted]

```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        ROWS = len(obstacleGrid)
        COLS = len(obstacleGrid[0])
        @cache
        def dp(r, c):
            if r >= ROWS or c >= COLS:
                return 0
            if obstacleGrid[r][c] == 1:
                return 0
            if r == ROWS - 1 and c == COLS - 1:
                return 1

            res = 0
            res += dp(r, c + 1)
            res += dp(r + 1, c)
            return res

        return dp(0, 0)
```

### Approach 1: Dynamic Programming

```python
class Solution(object):
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid: List[List[int]]) -> int:

        m = len(obstacleGrid)
        n = len(obstacleGrid[0])

        # If the starting cell has an obstacle, then simply return as there would be
        # no paths to the destination.
        if obstacleGrid[0][0] == 1:
            return 0

        # Number of ways of reaching the starting cell = 1.
        obstacleGrid[0][0] = 1

        # Filling the values for the first column
        for i in range(1, m):
            obstacleGrid[i][0] = int(
                obstacleGrid[i][0] == 0 and obstacleGrid[i - 1][0] == 1
            )

        # Filling the values for the first row
        for j in range(1, n):
            obstacleGrid[0][j] = int(
                obstacleGrid[0][j] == 0 and obstacleGrid[0][j - 1] == 1
            )

        # Starting from cell(1,1) fill up the values
        # No. of ways of reaching cell[i][j] = cell[i - 1][j] + cell[i][j - 1]
        # i.e. From above and left.
        for i in range(1, m):
            for j in range(1, n):
                if obstacleGrid[i][j] == 0:
                    obstacleGrid[i][j] = (
                        obstacleGrid[i - 1][j] + obstacleGrid[i][j - 1]
                    )
                else:
                    obstacleGrid[i][j] = 0

        # Return value stored in rightmost bottommost cell. That is the destination.
        return obstacleGrid[m - 1][n - 1]
```
