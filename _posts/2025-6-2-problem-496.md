## Problem Statement

[leetcode problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/description/)

## Intuition

The problem asks for the next greater element for each number in `nums1` based on their positions in `nums2`. A brute-force approach would involve scanning `nums2` for each element in `nums1` to find the next greater element, but that would be inefficient. Instead, we can use a monotonic stack to precompute the next greater elements for all items in `nums2`, which allows us to answer the query for each element in `nums1` efficiently.

## Approach (Monotonic Decreasing Stack)

We iterate through `nums2` from right to left and use a stack to keep track of elements in decreasing order. For each element `nums2[i]`, we remove elements from the stack that are less than or equal to it, since they can't be the next greater element for any previous numbers. If the stack is not empty after popping, the top element is the next greater element for `nums2[i]`.

We store this mapping in a hash map (`hash_map`). Initially, we only care about the elements in `nums1`, but to optimize and allow constant-time lookups, we store results for all elements in `nums2`.

After building the map, we simply look up the next greater element for each item in `nums1` from the hash map.

## Complexity

- Time complexity:  
  $$O(n + m)$$  
  Where \(n\) is the length of `nums2` and \(m\) is the length of `nums1`. We process each element in `nums2` once using the stack, and then each element in `nums1` is processed via hash map lookup.

- Space complexity:  
  $$O(n)$$  
  We use extra space for the stack and the hash map, both of which can grow up to the size of `nums2`.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def nextGreaterElement(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        stack = []
        hash_map = {i: -1 for i in nums1}
        for i in range(len(nums2) - 1, -1, -1):
            while stack and stack[-1] <= nums2[i]:
                stack.pop()

            hash_map[nums2[i]] = stack[-1] if stack else -1

            stack.append(nums2[i])

        res = []
        for x in nums1:
            res.append(hash_map[x])
        return res

```

## Editorial

### Approach 3: Using Stack

```python
class Solution:
    def nextGreaterElement(self, nums1, nums2):
        stack = []
        hashmap = {}

        for num in nums2:
            while stack and num > stack[-1]:
                hashmap[stack.pop()] = num
            stack.append(num)

        return [hashmap.get(i, -1) for i in nums1]
```
