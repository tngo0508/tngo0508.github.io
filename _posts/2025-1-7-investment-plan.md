## Investment Breakdown

I do not invest in 401(k) or 457(b) plans. Instead, I focus on contributing to a **Roth IRA**, a **Traditional IRA**, and ETFs through Robinhood. My strategy ensures consistent growth over time.

| **Yearly**       | **Track and Review Contributions**     | Annually      | - Review the total amount contributed to ETFs and IRAs during the year. <br>- Ensure I have maxed out my IRA contributions ($6,500 each for Roth and Traditional IRA). <br>- Confirm that biweekly ETF investments align with my annual goal ($38,246). <br>- Assess whether I can increase contributions based on salary growth or reduced expenses.   |
| **Yearly**       | **Rebalance Portfolio**                | Annually      | - Check my portfolio allocation percentages: <br> 10% QQQ, 20% BND, 50% SPY, 20% VEU, and IRAs. <br>- If any allocation deviates by 5% or more, rebalance by: <br> - Selling overperforming assets (in a tax-advantaged account if possible). <br> - Directing new contributions toward underperforming categories.                                     |
| **Monthly**      | **Monitor Portfolio Performance**      | Monthly       | - Track the performance of each ETF and IRA account. <br>- Use tools like Robinhood, Morningstar, or Yahoo Finance to analyze: <br> - ETF growth rates compared to benchmarks (e.g., S&P 500 for SPY). <br> - Performance consistency of IRAs. <br>- Adjust investment focus if any ETF significantly underperforms over a 6â€“12 month period.           |
| **Daily/Weekly** | **Stay Informed on Market Trends**     | Daily/Weekly  | - Read daily market updates from reliable sources like CNBC, Bloomberg, or The Wall Street Journal. <br>- Follow economic indicators that may affect my ETFs or the broader market (e.g., interest rate changes impacting BND or international developments for VEU). <br>- Avoid making impulsive investment decisions based on short-term volatility. |
| **Yearly**       | **Tax Optimization**                   | Annually      | - Review the tax implications of my investments: <br> - Ensure Roth IRA contributions stay within income limits. <br> - Use Traditional IRA contributions to reduce taxable income if eligible. <br> - Harvest tax losses (if applicable) in taxable accounts.                                                                                          |
| **Quarterly**    | **Evaluate ETF Allocation Strategy**   | Quarterly     | - Assess whether my current ETF strategy (QQQ, BND, SPY, VEU) aligns with my risk tolerance and financial goals. <br>- Consider adding new ETFs or diversifying further: <br> - Dividend ETFs (e.g., SCHD for income). <br> - Emerging market funds (e.g., VWO for higher growth). <br> - Real estate ETFs (e.g., VNQ for REIT exposure).               |
| **Yearly**       | **Review and Adjust Investment Goals** | Annually      | - Set financial goals for the next year based on progress: <br> - Increase biweekly ETF contributions if salary increases. <br> - Plan for long-term milestones (e.g., purchasing property, saving for future needs). <br>- Assess whether to shift focus toward higher-growth or more conservative investments based on life stage and risk tolerance. |

## Summary

Starting with $80,000 in Robinhood and focusing on contributing to **ETFs** and **IRAs**, I project the following growth:

- **3 Years:** ~$279,174 (Net Worth)
- **5 Years:** ~$452,078 (Net Worth)
- **7 Years:** ~$664,044 (Net Worth)
- **10 Years:** ~$1,071,058 (Net Worth)

This plan assumes consistent contributions, regular rebalancing, and a weighted annual return of approximately 6.1%. By maintaining this strategy and avoiding 401(k)/457(b) plans, I retain full control over my investments while optimizing long-term growth.
