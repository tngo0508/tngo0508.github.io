## Diversify Investment Strategy

### Additional ETFs to Consider

To strengthen my portfolio, I plan to add:

1. **SCHD** (Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF) for dividend income and stability.
2. **VNQ** (Vanguard Real Estate ETF) for exposure to real estate.
3. **VWO** (Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF) for higher growth potential.

| ----------------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| U.S. Large-Cap (SPY)    | 50%         | 40%           | Maintain strong U.S. exposure.  |
| Technology Growth (QQQ) | 10%         | 10%           | High-growth technology focus.   |
| Bonds (BND)             | 20%         | 15%           | Reduce bond exposure slightly.  |
| International (VEU)     | 20%         | 15%           | Slight reduction in allocation. |
| Real Estate (VNQ)       | N/A         | 10%           | Adds REITs for diversification. |
| Dividend-Focused (SCHD) | N/A         | 5%            | Generates income and stability. |
