## Calculation Formulas

1. **Total Contributions**  
   \[
   \text{Total Contributions} = \text{Annual Contribution} \times \text{Years}
   \]

2. **Projected Value (Nominal)**  
   \[
   \text{Projected Value} = \text{Total Contributions} \times (1 + \text{Growth Rate})^\text{Years}
   \]

3. **Inflation Adjustment (Real Value)**  
   \[
   \text{Real Value} = \frac{\text{Nominal Value}}{(1 + \text{Inflation Rate})^\text{Years}}
   \]

## My Action Plan

### Daily/Weekly

- Stay updated with market trends (e.g., CNBC, Bloomberg).
- Avoid impulsive decisions during volatility.

### Monthly

- Review ETF and IRA performance.
- Compare growth with benchmarks like the S&P 500.

### Quarterly

- Check portfolio allocation (e.g., QQQ: 10%, SPY: 50%).
- Diversify investments if needed (e.g., SCHD, VNQ).

### Annually

- Maximize ETF contributions ($38,246) and IRA contributions ($6,500).
- Rebalance portfolio to maintain allocation.
- Optimize taxes (e.g., Roth IRA limits, tax-loss harvesting).
- Review progress toward financial milestones.
