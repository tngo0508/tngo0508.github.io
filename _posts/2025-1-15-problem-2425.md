## Problem Statement

![problem](/assets/images/2025-01-15_19-50-23-problem-2425.jpg)

## Brute Force [TLE]

```python
class Solution:
    def xorAllNums(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        for x in nums1:
            for y in nums2:
                res = res ^ x ^ y
        return res
```

## Intuition

The problem involves finding the XOR of all elements resulting from the Cartesian product of two arrays. This can be simplified based on observations about the XOR operation:

1. XOR is commutative and associative, allowing flexibility in the order of operations.
2. Duplicating numbers in XOR cancels them out (e.g., \(x \oplus x = 0\)).
3. The XOR of the Cartesian product depends on the lengths of the arrays and their parities (even or odd).

## Approach

1. **Analyze the problem mathematically**:
   - Each number in `nums1` is XORed with all numbers in `nums2`, and vice versa.
   - If the length of an array is even, each number in the other array is XORed an even number of times and cancels out.
   - If the length is odd, every element contributes to the result exactly once.
2. **Identify cases based on array lengths**:

   - Both `nums1` and `nums2` have even lengths: No contribution to the XOR result as all elements cancel out.
   - One of the arrays has an odd length: Contribute all elements of the other array to the XOR result.
   - Both arrays have odd lengths: All elements from both arrays contribute to the XOR result.

3. **Implement the logic**:
   - Use simple loops to compute the XOR based on the identified cases.

## Complexity

- **Time complexity**:
  - \(O(\max(n, m))\), where \(n = \text{len(nums1)}\) and \(m = \text{len(nums2)}\). This is because, in the worst case, we iterate through one of the arrays entirely.
- **Space complexity**:
  - \(O(1)\), as we only use a constant amount of additional space.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def xorAllNums(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        n = len(nums1)
        m = len(nums2)
        if n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
            res = 0
        elif n % 2 != 0 and m % 2 == 0:
            for x in nums2:
                res ^= x
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            for x in nums1:
                res ^= x
        else:
            for x in nums2:
                res ^= x
            for x in nums1:
                res ^= x
        return res
```

## Editorial

### Approach 1: Hash Map

```python
class Solution:
    def xorAllNums(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> int:
        # Get lengths of arrays
        len1, len2 = len(nums1), len(nums2)

        # Dictionary to store frequency of each number
        freq = {}

        # Add frequencies for nums1 elements
        # Each element appears n2 times in final result
        for num in nums1:
            freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + len2

        # Add frequencies for nums2 elements
        # Each element appears n1 times in final result
        for num in nums2:
            freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + len1

        # XOR numbers that appear odd number of times
        ans = 0
        for num in freq:
            if freq[num] % 2:
                ans ^= num

        return ans
```

### Approach 2: Space Optimized Bit Manipulation

```python
class Solution:
    def xorAllNums(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> int:
        # Initialize XOR results for both arrays
        xor1, xor2 = 0, 0

        # Get lengths of both arrays
        len1, len2 = len(nums1), len(nums2)

        # If nums2 length is odd, each element in nums1 appears odd times in final result
        if len2 % 2:
            for num in nums1:
                xor1 ^= num

        # If nums1 length is odd, each element in nums2 appears odd times in final result
        if len1 % 2:
            for num in nums2:
                xor2 ^= num

        # Return XOR of both results
        return xor1 ^ xor2
```
