## Problem Statement

![problem](/assets/images/2024-11-26_19-58-47-problem3243.png)

## Intuition

To solve this problem, the goal is to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph after each query. Initially, the graph is a directed chain where each node is connected to its next one. After each query, a new directed edge is added between two nodes. The task is to calculate the shortest distance from the source node (0) to the destination node (n-1) after each query.

The problem can be approached using a breadth-first search (BFS) because BFS guarantees that we find the shortest path in an unweighted graph. However, as the graph is updated after each query, we must recompute the shortest distance after each addition of a new edge.

## Approach

1. **Initial Setup:**
   We start by initializing a graph where each node points to the next node in the sequence. The graph is represented as an adjacency list. For example, for `n = 5`, the initial graph would be `{0: [1], 1: [2], 2: [3], 3: [4], 4: []}`.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
   For each query, which specifies a new edge from `src` to `dest`, we perform BFS to find the shortest path from node `0` to node `n-1`. BFS works by exploring the graph level by level, ensuring that once we reach the destination node `n-1`, the path we took is the shortest.

3. **Handling Queries:**
   After each query, we add the edge from `src` to `dest` to the graph and perform BFS again to compute the new shortest path.

4. **Recomputing After Each Query:**
   After processing each query, we store the result (the shortest path distance) and proceed to the next query. This is done for every query in the list of queries.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the graph is disconnected or if no path exists from node 0 to node `n-1`, BFS will return the maximum possible steps (though this situation should ideally be handled in the code).

## Complexity

- **Time complexity:**  
  Each query requires performing BFS, which has a time complexity of $$O(n + m)$$, where `n` is the number of nodes and `m` is the number of edges in the graph. Since we perform BFS for each query, the total time complexity is $$O(q \cdot (n + m))$$, where `q` is the number of queries.

- **Space complexity:**  
  The space complexity is dominated by the storage required for the graph and the BFS queue. The graph uses $$O(n + m)$$ space, and the queue and visited set used in BFS also require $$O(n)$$ space. Therefore, the total space complexity is $$O(n + m)$$.

## Code

```python
from collections import deque
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def shortestDistanceAfterQueries(self, n: int, queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        # Initial graph setup: each node points to the next node in sequence.
        graph = {i: [i + 1] for i in range(n)}

        # BFS to find the shortest path from node 0 to node n-1
        def bfs():
            q = deque([[0, 0]])  # Start from node 0 with 0 steps
            visited = set()  # Set to track visited nodes
            while q:
                node, step = q.popleft()
                if node == n - 1:  # If we reach the last node, return the steps
                    return step
                for nei in graph[node]:
                    if nei not in visited:
                        visited.add(nei)
                        q.append([nei, step + 1])

            return step  # If no path exists, return the last known step

        # List to store results for each query
        res = []

        # Process each query, add the new edge and compute shortest distance
        for src, dest in queries:
            graph[src].append(dest)  # Add the edge as per the query
            res.append(bfs())  # Perform BFS and append the result

        return res
```

### Approach 1: Breadth First Search (BFS)

```python
class Solution:

    # Helper function to perform BFS and find the number of edges in the shortest path from node 0 to node n-1
    def bfs(self, n: int, adj_list: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        visited = [False] * n
        node_queue = deque()

        # Start BFS from node 0
        node_queue.append(0)
        visited[0] = True

        # Track the number of nodes in the current layer and the next layer
        current_layer_node_count = 1
        next_layer_node_count = 0
        # Initialize layers explored count
        layers_explored = 0

        # Perform BFS until the queue is empty
        while node_queue:
            # Process nodes in the current layer
            for _ in range(current_layer_node_count):
                current_node = node_queue.popleft()

                # Check if we reached the destination node
                if current_node == n - 1:
                    return layers_explored  # Return the number of edges in the shortest path

                # Explore all adjacent nodes
                for neighbor in adj_list[current_node]:
                    if visited[neighbor]:
                        continue
                    node_queue.append(
                        neighbor
                    )  # Add neighbor to the queue for exploration
                    next_layer_node_count += (
                        1  # Increment the count of nodes in the next layer
                    )
                    visited[neighbor] = True

            # Move to the next layer
            current_layer_node_count = next_layer_node_count
            next_layer_node_count = 0  # Reset next layer count
            layers_explored += 1  # Increment the layer count after processing the current layer

        return -1  # Algorithm will never reach this point

    def shortestDistanceAfterQueries(
        self, n: int, queries: List[List[int]]
    ) -> List[int]:
        answer = []
        adj_list = [[] for _ in range(n)]

        # Initialize the graph with edges between consecutive nodes
        for i in range(n - 1):
            adj_list[i].append(i + 1)

        # Process each query to add new roads
        for road in queries:
            u, v = road
            adj_list[u].append(v)  # Add road from u to v
            # Perform BFS to find the shortest path after adding the new road
            answer.append(self.bfs(n, adj_list))

        return answer
```

### Approach 2: Recursive Dynamic Programming (Top-Down)

```python
class Solution:
    # Recursive function to find the minimum distance from the current node to
    # the destination node (n-1)
    def find_min_distance(self, adj_list, n, current_node, dp):
        # We've reached the destination node
        if current_node == n - 1:
            return 0

        # If this node has already been computed, return the stored value
        if dp[current_node] != -1:
            return dp[current_node]

        min_distance = n

        for neighbor in adj_list[current_node]:
            # Recursively find the minimum distance from the neighbor to the destination
            min_distance = min(
                min_distance,
                self.find_min_distance(adj_list, n, neighbor, dp) + 1,
            )

        # Store the computed minimum distance in the dp array and return it
        dp[current_node] = min_distance
        return min_distance

    def shortestDistanceAfterQueries(self, n, queries):
        dp = [-1] * n  # DP array to store minimum distances from each node
        adj_list = [[] for _ in range(n)]

        # Initialize the graph with edges between consecutive nodes
        for i in range(n - 1):
            adj_list[i].append(i + 1)

        answer = []

        # Process each query to add new edges
        for road in queries:
            u = road[0]
            v = road[1]

            # Add the directed edge from u to v
            adj_list[u].append(v)

            # Find the minimum distance from the starting node (0) to the destination (n-1)
            answer.append(self.find_min_distance(adj_list, n, 0, dp))

            # Clear and reset the dp array
            dp = [-1] * n

        return answer  # Return the results for each query
```

### Approach 3: Iterative Dynamic Programming (Bottom-Up)

```python
class Solution:
    # Function to find the minimum distance from node 0 to node n-1
    def find_min_distance(self, adj_list, n):
        dp = [0] * n
        dp[n - 1] = 0  # Base case: distance to destination (n-1) is 0

        # Iterate from the second last node down to the first node
        for current_node in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            min_distance = n
            # Explore neighbors to find the minimum distance
            for neighbor in adj_list[current_node]:
                min_distance = min(min_distance, dp[neighbor] + 1)
            # Store the calculated distance for the current node
            dp[current_node] = min_distance

        return dp[0]

    def shortestDistanceAfterQueries(self, n, queries):
        answer = []
        adj_list = [[] for _ in range(n)]

        # Initialize edges between consecutive nodes
        for i in range(n - 1):
            adj_list[i].append(i + 1)

        # Process each query to add new edges
        for road in queries:
            u, v = road[0], road[1]
            adj_list[u].append(v)  # Add the directed edge from u to v

            # Calculate the minimum distance after adding the new edge
            answer.append(self.find_min_distance(adj_list, n))

        return answer
```
