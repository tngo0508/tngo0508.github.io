## Problem Statement

![problem-786](/assets/images/2024-05-09_20-07-09-problem-786.png)

## Intuition

I see the problem involves finding the kth smallest prime fraction from a given list of integers. Since we're dealing with fractions and looking for the smallest ones, it might be helpful to consider sorting them somehow.

## Approach

One approach could be to generate all possible fractions using the elements from the array. Then, we can use a min-heap to keep track of the smallest fractions. By popping elements from the heap k times, we can find the kth smallest fraction.

## Complexity

- Time complexity:
  O(n^2 log k) where n is the the length of array. Generating all possible fractions takes O(n^2) time and each heap operation takes log k time

- Space complexity:
  O(n^2)

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def kthSmallestPrimeFraction(self, arr: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        min_heap = []
        N = len(arr)
        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(i + 1, N):
                val = arr[i] / arr[j]
                heapq.heappush(min_heap, [val, i, j])

        res = []
        for _ in range(k):
            res = heapq.heappop(min_heap)

        return [arr[res[1]], arr[res[2]]]
```

## Max-heap Approach

```python
class Solution:
    def kthSmallestPrimeFraction(self, arr: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        max_heap = []
        N = len(arr)
        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(i + 1, N):
                val = arr[i] / arr[j]
                heapq.heappush(max_heap, [val * -1, i, j])
                if len(max_heap) > k:
                    heapq.heappop(max_heap)

        _, i, j = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
        return [arr[i], arr[j]]
```

## Editorial Solution

Approach 2: Priority Queue

```python
class Solution:
    def kthSmallestPrimeFraction(self, arr, k):
        # Create a priority queue to store pairs of fractions
        pq = []

        # Custom comparator for priority queue
        def compare(a, b):
            return a[0] - b[0]

        # Push the fractions formed by dividing each element by
        # the largest element into the priority queue
        for i in range(len(arr)):
            heapq.heappush(pq, ((arr[i] / arr[-1]), i, len(arr) - 1))

        # Iteratively remove the top element (smallest fraction)
        # and replace it with the next smallest fraction
        for _ in range(k - 1):
            cur = heapq.heappop(pq)
            numerator_index = cur[1]
            denominator_index = cur[2] - 1
            if denominator_index > numerator_index:
                heapq.heappush(pq, (
                    (arr[numerator_index] / arr[denominator_index]),
                    numerator_index,
                    denominator_index
                ))

        # Retrieve the kth smallest fraction from
        # the top of the priority queue
        result = heapq.heappop(pq)
        return [arr[result[1]], arr[result[2]]]
```
