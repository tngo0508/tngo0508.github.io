## Problem Statement

[leetcode problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/simplify-path/description/)

## Stack Approach [Accepted]

```python
class Solution:
    def simplifyPath(self, path: str) -> str:
        path_arr = path.split('/')
        stack = []
        for folder in path_arr:
            if not folder or folder == '.':
                continue
            if folder == '..' and stack:
                stack.pop()
            if folder and folder not in ('..', '.'):
                stack.append(folder)

        return '/' + '/'.join(stack)
```

## Editorial

```python
class Solution:
    def simplifyPath(self, path: str) -> str:

        # Initialize a stack
        stack = []

        # Split the input string on "/" as the delimiter
        # and process each portion one by one
        for portion in path.split("/"):

            # If the current component is a "..", then
            # we pop an entry from the stack if it's non-empty
            if portion == "..":
                if stack:
                    stack.pop()
            elif portion == "." or not portion:
                # A no-op for a "." or an empty string
                continue
            else:
                # Finally, a legitimate directory name, so we add it
                # to our stack
                stack.append(portion)

        # Stich together all the directory names together
        final_str = "/" + "/".join(stack)
        return final_str
```
