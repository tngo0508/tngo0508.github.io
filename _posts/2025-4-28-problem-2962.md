## Problem Statement

[leetcode problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-players-with-zero-or-one-losses/description/)

## Intuition

We need to find the number of subarrays where the **maximum element** appears **exactly `k` times**.  
Since the maximum value of the entire array is fixed, we can track how many times it appears within a sliding window to efficiently find valid subarrays.

## Approach

- First, calculate the maximum value `max_val` in the array.
- Use two pointers (`start` and `end`) to form a sliding window:
  - Move `end` forward through the array.
  - Whenever `nums[end] == max_val`, increase `count`.
- When `count == k`, it means the current window `[start, end]` contains exactly `k` occurrences of `max_val`.
  - **Important:** Once we have a valid window, any subarray that starts at `start` or later and ends at `end` (or later) will still have exactly `k` `max_val` values (because `end` is fixed at the moment).
  - Since `end` can be extended to `N-1` without changing the count, the number of valid subarrays is `(N - end)`.
- After counting, shrink the window from the left by moving `start`, and decrease `count` if `nums[start] == max_val`.

### Why `(N - end)`?

When we find a valid window where the number of `max_val` is exactly `k`, the subarrays:

- `[start, end]`
- `[start+1, end]`
- `[start+2, end]`
- ...
- and so on, up to the end of the array
  will all be valid without changing the number of `max_val`.  
  Thus, there are `(N - end)` valid subarrays for the current `start`.

## Complexity

- Time complexity:  
  $$O(n)$$  
  Both `start` and `end` pointers move from left to right across the array, each visiting each element at most once.

- Space complexity:  
  $$O(1)$$  
  We only use a few extra integer variables.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def countSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        res = 0
        start = 0
        N = len(nums)
        count = 0
        max_val = max(nums)
        for end in range(N):
            count += 1 if nums[end] == max_val else 0
            while count == k and start <= end:
                res += (N - end)
                count -= 1 if nums[start] == max_val else 0
                start += 1
        return res
```

## Editorial

### Approach 1: Sliding Window

```python
class Solution:
    def countSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        max_element = max(nums)
        ans = start = max_elements_in_window = 0

        for end in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[end] == max_element:
                max_elements_in_window += 1
            while max_elements_in_window == k:
                if nums[start] == max_element:
                    max_elements_in_window -= 1
                start += 1
            ans += start
        return ans
```
