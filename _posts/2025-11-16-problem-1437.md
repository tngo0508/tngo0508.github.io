## Problem Statement

[leetcode problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-all-1s-are-at-least-length-k-places-away/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-11-17)

## Brute Force [Accepted]

```python
class Solution:
    def kLengthApart(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> bool:
        prev = -k - 1
        curr = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] == 1:
                places_away = i - prev - 1
                if places_away < k:
                    return False
                prev = i
        return True
```

## Editorial

### Approach 1: One Pass + Count

```python
class Solution:
    def kLengthApart(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> bool:
        # initialize the counter of zeros to k
        # to pass the first 1 in nums
        count = k

        for num in nums:
            # if the current integer is 1
            if num == 1:
                # check that number of zeros in-between 1s
                # is greater than or equal to k
                if count < k:
                    return False
                # reinitialize counter
                count = 0
            # if the current integer is 0
            else:
                # increase the counter
                count += 1

        return True
```

### Approach 2: Bit Manipulation

```python
class Solution:
    def kLengthApart(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> bool:
        # convert binary array into int
        x = 0
        for num in nums:
            x = (x << 1) | num

        # base case
        if x == 0 or k == 0:
            return True

        # remove trailing zeros
        while x & 1 == 0:
            x = x >> 1

        while x != 1:
            # remove trailing 1-bit
            x = x >> 1

            # count trailing zeros
            count = 0
            while x & 1 == 0:
                x = x >> 1
                count += 1

            # number of zeros in-between 1-bits
            # should be greater than or equal to k
            if count < k:
                return False

        return True
```
