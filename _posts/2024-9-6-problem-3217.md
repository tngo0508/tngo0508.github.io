## Problem Statement

![problem](/assets/images/2024-09-06_11-16-12-problem-3217.png)

## Intuition

The goal is to modify the linked list by removing nodes whose values are present in the given list `nums`. My first thought is to use a set for quick lookup of values from `nums`, and then traverse the linked list while skipping nodes that match the values in the set.

## Approach

1. Convert the list `nums` into a set for faster lookups.
2. Use a sentinel node to handle edge cases (e.g., when the head node itself needs to be removed).
3. Traverse the linked list, and for each node:
   - If the node's value is in the set, skip it.
   - Otherwise, link it to the previous node.
4. Return the modified list starting from the node next to the sentinel.

## Complexity

- Time complexity:
  The time complexity is $$O(n + m)$$ where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list and `m` is the number of elements in the `nums` list. This is because we convert `nums` to a set in $$O(m)$$ and then traverse the linked list in $$O(n)$$.

- Space complexity:
  The space complexity is $$O(m)$$ because we store `nums` in a set.

## Code

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def modifiedList(self, nums: List[int], head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        nums_set = set(nums)
        curr = head
        sentinel = ListNode(-1, head)
        prev = sentinel
        while curr:
            if curr.val in nums_set:
                curr = curr.next
            else:
                prev.next = curr
                prev = curr
                curr = curr.next
        prev.next = curr
        return sentinel.next
```

## Editorial

### Approach: Hash Set

```python
class Solution:
    def modifiedList(
        self, nums: List[int], head: Optional[ListNode]
    ) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # Create a set for efficient lookup of values in nums
        values_to_remove = set(nums)

        # Handle the case where the head node needs to be removed
        while head and head.val in values_to_remove:
            head = head.next

        # If the list is empty after removing head nodes, return None
        if not head:
            return None

        # Iterate through the list, removing nodes with values in the set
        current = head
        while current.next:
            if current.next.val in values_to_remove:
                # Skip the next node by updating the pointer
                current.next = current.next.next
            else:
                # Move to the next node
                current = current.next

        return head
```
