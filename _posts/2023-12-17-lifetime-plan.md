# A Blueprint for Growth
In this journal, I'm outlining my lifetime goals, covering both short-term and long-term aspirations. My goals have taken a backseat for far too long, owing to the demands of work, bouts of depression, and a tendency to overthink. While I've achieved academic milestones, earning a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Science, these accomplishments don't feel like major strides in the grand scheme of my ambitions. I've come to realize that my lack of commitment and penchant for giving up too easily have been stumbling blocks.

Comparing myself to others and allowing external opinions to shape my goals and career decisions has been a major mistake. I'm now aware that the constant comparison steals away the joy of my journey. It's time to focus on self-improvement and set my own benchmarks.

To rectify these shortcomings, I am now committed to crafting a detailed plan for my future. I've had dreams of a perfect version of myselfâ€”a person radiating confidence, both mentally and physically. I am determined to transform into that person gradually, step by step, and this journal serves as a guide to creating a better version of myself.

Firstly, I'm addressing fundamental questions about my purpose and goals in life. My long-term goal is to be in the top 1% globally, specifically in terms of wealth. While some may view this as unrealistic, it's my ambition, my definition of success, and my motivation. I want to be exceedingly wealthy, and I believe that with consistency and discipline, I can achieve this.

To break down this long-term goal, I recognize the need for a good income and wise investments. I plan to secure a stable job to contribute to both. Changing my mindset, improving my personality, and enhancing technical skills are essential steps in achieving this.

Changing my mindset involves overcoming overthinking and transforming ideas into action. I've realized the importance of keeping plans to myself until they materialize, avoiding self-satisfaction through mere discussion.

Improving my personality means becoming more resilient to negative feedback and turning it into a driving force for success. I aim to be an emotionless person in the face of challenges, using feedback constructively.

Enhancing technical skills, including writing, reading, and problem-solving, is crucial for success in my field. These skills are not only relevant but essential for career growth. I commit to daily writing and reading exercises, leveraging the "2-minute method" for reading, and dedicating time to problem-solving through platforms like Leetcode.

This plan is a starting point for my journey toward a better version of myself. While subject to refinement, it marks a commitment to personal growth, even in my early 30s. It's never too late to strive for excellence.

# For Future Me
Embark on the journey to personal excellence outlined in this plan. Commit to growth, embrace change, and strive for the better version of yourself. The path may be challenging, but with consistency and discipline, success awaits. Start now; it's never too late.
