In this journal, I want to define my lifetime goals including both short-term and long-term. I have been ignoring my goals for a long time due to busy work, depression and overthinking. Now, I have a plenty of time to reflect my experience and lessons that I learned in the past. I realized that within my 20s, I have not achieved much besides my academic achievements. To be truthful to myself, even though I already got the bachelor's and master's degree in Computer Science, I don't think it's any big accomplishments in my life. I used to aim higher than this before. My degrees are not from a prestige school either. It's just from a mediocre school in the U.S. Currently, I am sitting down and pondering the reason why. I recognized it happened because of my undetermined decisions and lack of commitment. I always want to be above average. To be precise, I hate being average or below that level. Also, when I meet any obstacles in life, work, or even entertainment. I gave up too easily. I hate myself for that. Another mistake that I made is comparing myself to other people too much. As people used to say, comparison is the thief of joy. This sentence that I learned later in my life. I find it is quite true. I should not compare myself to other people, but rather I should've compare myself with myself in the past, like yesterday, a week ago, a month ago or so. Finally, I let other people and actions dictate my goals and career to much. I am stupid to believe something that some people told me even though those ill advices are completely irrelevant and not helpful to me. However, rather than sitting here and cry for the things that I have missed in life, I am recollecting myself and devise a formal plan for my future. I have been neglecting it for so long. It's time for me to write down a detailed plan, what I really want to achieve in life. Looking in the past 10 years, I have not built any legacy for myself or anyone. I do not contribute anything useful to the humanity or even family. I admit that I am a selfish and lazy person. And, I really want to change it. I want to sacrifice myself for what I want to become in the future.

There was sometime I had strange dreams about talking to myself. But the person that I talked to is the perfect and the best version of me. I look at him in the eyes and see not the doubt or low self-esteem but the immense confidence. He's strong both physically and mentally. And I am eager to becoming that person. With that said, here I come with the plan to kill my current self or rebuild myself into a better person. This is the self notes to myself on how to create the better version of me gradually, step by step with formal and detail plan. 

First, I am wondering and answering the big questions in my mind for along time. Why am I here? What is my purpose in life? Who do I really want to become? Where do I want to be? When do I want to do it? In order to answer these questions, I need to create the short-term and long-term goals to help me find my true answers to these questions. So, let me start with the long-term goal. Now, I have time to consider about this. I have been thinking about it all day long and I think it my long-term goal or lifetime goal would be the top 1% of the world. Yes, it sounds ridiculous and funny for a person like to say this. But you know what, it's my dream and it's my goal. When I am dreaming or set my goal, why do I want to make it small? And since it's called a long time goal in life or lifetime goal, I want to make it so that I want to keep growth and keep improving myself. Some people may consider this goal is unrealistic, but to be it's my ambition, it's my definition of success and motivation. I know it's really hard to reach that level, but eventually i will achieve it somehow. Now, perhaps I don't feel like I have that confidence, but with consistency and discipline, I highly believe in myself to achieve anything in life. Now I settle down the general long-term goal. I need to be more details about top 1% in what. So, I take a moment and reconsider that again. It's too broad to define the 1% of the world. I need to be specific. I really want to be 1% in wealth. I want to be rich. So that's exactly my real and true goal. Yes, I want to be filthy rich, extremely rich, insanely rich. That's my long-term goal. Now, I know my goal. Then, let me focus on how I can achieve this long-term goal by breaking down into smaller easy achievable short-term goals.

Basically, since I want to be rich. That means that I need to have either good investments or high end income, or even multiple income sources. I feel like these should be part of each other. If I can have a really good income or high salary, I could contribute half of that to my investment. how do I get good income? I need to find a good and stable job. It is not necessary extremely high, but the job should be good enough so that I can consistently add the flow of money to my investment. What do I invest in? Currently, I am investing in stock, but I feel like I want to invest in to real estate like buying houses as well. So, step by step, I need to find a job first. I need to escape this unemployment period and get back to the workforce as soon as possible. How do I do that? I need to change my mindset, change my personality, improve my technical skills. 

What do I mean by changing my mindset? I used to overthink a lot. I need to stop thinking and start doing more than I think. I need to stop talking about my ideas and plans to other people since I feel like by talking to other people, I just self-satisfy myself into it and I have never actually executed the ideas or plan.

What do I mean by changing my personality? I mean my current personality is completely shit. When I get mad or get negative feedback, my personality cannot take it well. I need to train myself into an emotionless person who can immune to the negative feedback. I need to become a person that I can take constructive feedback or negative energy and turn into my own power and use it to drive my success

what about improving my technical skills? First of all the writing and reading skill, I need to write and read at the level that exceed the average person. What I learn from the past is that these skills are so important to me that I rely on it on the daily basis. At first, I thought being a software engineer, writing and reading are irrelevant to my career. But later in life, I learned it the hard way. The writing and reading skills are so important that if I don't write an email or resume correctly and properly, I couldn't get the job. If I don't read the manual or documentation right, I can never make my code working. Also, another skill is problem-solving. As a software engineer, without this skill, I would be a useless engineer. So, no doubt i need this skill desperately. 

So, my long-term goal is to be rich or 1% of wealth in general. The breakdown short-term goals are
1. Get decent jobs to generate the constantly streaming flow of income to invest into my venture like stocks and houses
2. In order to get the job, I need to get back to the workforce soon. I need to change mind set, personality, and technical skills
3. Change my mindset by stop overthinking, stop talking about the plans to other people, stop doubting myself. And start believing in whatever I am trying to do. Without faith and belief, everything else seems to be useless.
4. Change my personality by staying calm in the worst scenarios, no matter what happens, I need to stay calm as much as I can. I don't want to get frustrated by any coworkers, family member, rage driver, etc. I am getting irritated to easily. I definitely need to fix this. I know it's hard and a long term progress. But step by step, I will be calm as water in a tranquil and quiet let. There is a sentence saying the mind is like water, when it's turbulent, it's difficult for me to see things. When it's calm, I can see everything clear. 
5. improving my technical skills by improving 
- writing
  - I need to write as much as I can
  - I need to read many books
  - I need to focus on my grammar
  - I need to write at least 15 - 30 minutes a day
- reading
  - I need to spend at least 2 minutes reading. I know this is small amount of time, but I am trying to apply the 2 minutes method from the book Atomic Habit. I hope it will transform my reading skill
  - I need to read consistency
  - I need to discipline myself in reading instead of watching Netflix, playing videos, or sleeping
  - I need to sleep less and read more
- Problem-solving
  - I need to do Leetcode 1 problem per day, no matter what
  - I need to solve the problem in project or whatever that can help me improve problem solving
  - I need to spend more time figuring the issues and take time to understand algorithm


With that being said, this is my first version of my plan to achieve my lifetime goal. Of course, this could be subject to change in the future. But at least I want to write these things down and starts somewhere. I need it's kind of late at my early 30. But I think I can still do this. It's better late than never.
