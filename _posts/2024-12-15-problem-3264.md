## Problem Statement

## Explanation

### Intuition

> The **intuition** is to efficiently manipulate the smallest element repeatedly.  
> Instead of scanning the entire array each time to find the smallest element, we utilize a **min-heap**, which provides direct access to the smallest element in _O(log n)_ time.

### Approach

1. **Initialize a Min-Heap:**  
   Place all elements `(value, index)` into a **min-heap**. The heap keeps track of elements in ascending order, ensuring the smallest element is always at the top.

2. **Perform k Operations:**

   - Extract the smallest element from the heap.
   - Multiply it by the given `multiplier`.
   - Push the new value back into the heap.

   Repeating this _k_ times ensures that we have successively transformed the smallest values.

3. **Reconstruct the Final Array:**
   After _k_ operations, the heap contains the transformed elements. Extract each element and place it back into the original array using the stored index.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**

  - Building the heap initially: $$O(n)$$
  - Each of the _k_ steps involves one heap pop and one heap push: $$O(\log n)$$ per step.  
    Total: $$O(n + k \log n)$$

- **Space Complexity:**  
  We use a heap that stores all elements: $$O(n)$$

### Code

```python
import heapq
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def getFinalState(self, nums: List[int], k: int, multiplier: int) -> List[int]:
        min_heap = []
        # Build the min-heap from all elements
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            heapq.heappush(min_heap, [num, i])

        # Perform k operations
        while k > 0:
            val, i = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
            heapq.heappush(min_heap, [val * multiplier, i])
            k -= 1

        # Reconstruct the final array from heap
        while min_heap:
            val, i = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
            nums[i] = val

        return nums
```

## Editorial

### Approach 1: K Full Array Scans for Minimum Element Multiplication

```python
class Solution:
    def getFinalState(self, nums: List[int], k: int, multiplier: int):
        n = len(nums)

        for _ in range(k):
            # Find the index of the smallest element in the array
            min_index = 0
            for i in range(n):
                if nums[i] < nums[min_index]:
                    min_index = i

            # Multiply the smallest element by the multiplier
            nums[min_index] *= multiplier

        return nums
```

### Approach 2: Heap-Optimized K Minimum Value Multiplication

```python
class Solution:
    def getFinalState(self, nums: List[int], k: int, multiplier: int):
        pq = [(val, i) for i, val in enumerate(nums)]
        heapify(pq)

        for _ in range(k):
            _, i = heappop(pq)
            nums[i] *= multiplier
            heappush(pq, (nums[i], i))

        return nums
```
