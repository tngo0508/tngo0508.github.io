## Problem Statement

![2586](/assets/images/2024-06-02_17-48-28-problem-2486.png)

## Brute Force - TLE

```python
class Solution:
    def appendCharacters(self, s: str, t: str) -> int:
        res = float('inf')
        s_len = len(s)
        t_len = len(t)
        for i in range(s_len):
            for j in range(i, s_len):
                l = j
                k = 0
                if s[l] == t[k]:
                    while k < t_len and l < s_len:
                        if s[l] == t[k]:
                            k += 1
                        l += 1

                res = min(res, t_len - k)

        return res if res != float('inf') else 0
```

- Time: O(s_len x s_len x t_len)
- Space: O(s_len ^ 2 x t_len)

## Intuition

When I first looked at this problem, I thought about how I can find the minimum number of characters I need to append to the string `s` to make `t` a subsequence of `s`. The goal is to efficiently traverse both strings and determine the necessary number of additional characters.

## Approach

My approach involves a two-pointer technique. I use one pointer to traverse `s` and another pointer to traverse `t`. I increment both pointers when the characters at their current positions match. If the characters don't match, I only increment the pointer for `s`. This way, I effectively find how much of `t` can be matched by `s` without any additions. The difference between the length of `t` and the number of characters matched gives the result.

## Complexity

- Time complexity: The time complexity of my approach is \(O(n + m)\), where \(n\) is the length of `s` and \(m\) is the length of `t`. This is because we traverse each string at most once.
- Space complexity: The space complexity of my approach is \(O(1)\) because I only use a fixed amount of extra space for the pointers and a few variables.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def appendCharacters(self, s: str, t: str) -> int:
        s_len = len(s)
        t_len = len(t)
        s_idx, t_idx = 0, 0
        while s_idx < s_len and t_idx < t_len:
            if s[s_idx] == t[t_idx]:
                t_idx += 1
            s_idx += 1

        return t_len - t_idx

```
