## Problem Statement

![problem](/assets/images/2024-09-11_18-50-37-problem-1684.png)

## Intuition

<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->

The problem is asking to count how many strings in the `words` list consist only of characters present in the `allowed` string. The first thought is to use a set to check if each word contains only valid characters, since set lookup is efficient and the problem doesn't require ordering or duplicates.

## Approach

<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->

1. Convert the `allowed` string into a set `allowed_set`, which allows for O(1) lookups.
2. Initialize a counter `res` to count how many words meet the criteria.
3. Iterate over each word in the `words` list:
   - Convert the word to a set to remove duplicate characters.
   - For each character in the word, check if it exists in `allowed_set`.
   - If a word contains any character not in the `allowed_set`, break the loop.
   - If all characters in the word are valid, increment the `res` counter.
4. Return the count `res` after checking all words.

## Complexity

- Time complexity:
  <!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

  The time complexity is $$O(n \cdot m)$$, where $$n$$ is the number of words in the `words` list and $$m$$ is the average length of each word. This is because for each word, we need to check each of its characters against the `allowed_set`.

- Space complexity:
  <!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
  The space complexity is $$O(1)$$ for the counter and temporary variables, but $$O(k)$$ for the `allowed_set` and $$O(m)$$ for each word set, where $$k$$ is the number of unique characters in `allowed` and $$m$$ is the size of the word.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def countConsistentStrings(self, allowed: str, words: List[str]) -> int:
        res = 0
        allowed_set = set(allowed)
        for word in words:
            word_set = set(word)
            for c in word_set:
                if c not in allowed_set:
                    break
            else:
                res += 1
        return res
```

## Editorial

### Approach 1: Brute Force

```python
class Solution:
    def countConsistentStrings(self, allowed: str, words: List[str]) -> int:
        consistent_count = 0

        # Iterate through each word in the words list
        for word in words:
            is_word_consistent = True

            # Check each character in the current word
            for char in word:
                is_char_allowed = False

                # Check if the current character is in the allowed string
                for allowed_char in allowed:
                    if allowed_char == char:
                        is_char_allowed = True
                        break  # Character found, no need to continue searching

                # If the character is not allowed, mark the word as inconsistent
                if not is_char_allowed:
                    is_word_consistent = False
                    break  # No need to check remaining characters

            # If the word is consistent, increment the count
            if is_word_consistent:
                consistent_count += 1

        return consistent_count
```

- time: O(m \* n \* k)
- space: O(1)

### Approach 2: Boolean Array

```python
class Solution:
    def countConsistentStrings(self, allowed: str, words: List[str]) -> int:
        # Create a boolean list to mark which characters are allowed
        is_allowed = [False] * 26

        # Mark all characters in 'allowed' as True in the is_allowed list
        for char in allowed:
            is_allowed[ord(char) - ord("a")] = True

        consistent_count = 0

        # Iterate through each word in the words list
        for word in words:
            is_consistent = True

            # Check each character of the current word
            for char in word:
                # If any character is not allowed, mark as inconsistent and break
                if not is_allowed[ord(char) - ord("a")]:
                    is_consistent = False
                    break

            # If the word is consistent, increment the count
            if is_consistent:
                consistent_count += 1

        return consistent_count
```

- time: O(m + n \* k)
- space: O(1)

### Approach 3: Hash Set

```python
class Solution:
    def countConsistentStrings(self, allowed: str, words: List[str]) -> int:
        # Create a set to store the allowed characters
        allowed_chars = set(allowed)

        consistent_count = 0

        # Iterate through each word in the 'words' list
        for word in words:
            # Check if all characters in the word are in allowed_chars
            if all(char in allowed_chars for char in word):
                consistent_count += 1

        # Return the total count of consistent strings
        return consistent_count
```

- time: O(m + n \* k)
- space: O(m)

### Approach 4: Bit Manipulation

```python
class Solution:
    def countConsistentStrings(self, allowed: str, words: List[str]) -> int:
        # Create a bitmask representing the allowed characters
        allowed_bits = 0

        # Set the corresponding bit for each character in allowed
        for char in allowed:
            allowed_bits |= 1 << (ord(char) - ord("a"))

        consistent_count = 0

        # Iterate through each word in the words list
        for word in words:
            is_consistent = True

            # Check each character in the word
            for char in word:
                # Calculate the bit position for the current character
                bit = (allowed_bits >> (ord(char) - ord("a"))) & 1

                # If the bit is 0, the character is not allowed
                if not bit:
                    is_consistent = False
                    break

            # If the word is consistent, increment the count
            if is_consistent:
                consistent_count += 1

        return consistent_count
```
