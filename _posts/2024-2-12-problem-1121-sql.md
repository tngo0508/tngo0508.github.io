## Problem

[![problem-1211](/assets/images/2024-02-12_19-27-54-problem-1211.png)](/assets/images/2024-02-12_19-27-54-problem-1211.png)

## Query

```sql
SELECT
    query_name,
    ROUND(AVG(rating / position), 2) AS quality,
    ROUND(SUM(IF(rating < 3, 1, 0)) / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) AS poor_query_percentage
FROM
    Queries
WHERE
    query_name IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    query_name
```

## Approach: CASE WHEN instead of IF

```sql
select
query_name,
round(avg(cast(rating as decimal) / position), 2) as quality,
round(sum(case when rating < 3 then 1 else 0 end) * 100 / count(*), 2) as poor_query_percentage
from
queries
group by
query_name;
```
