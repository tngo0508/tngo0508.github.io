## Problem Statement

[leetcode problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-transaction-fee/description/)

## Memoization [Accepted]

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int], fee: int) -> int:
        @cache
        def dp(i, is_holding):
            if i == len(prices):
                return 0
            ans = 0
            # can substract the fee in either buy or sell
            if not is_holding:
                # buy stock
                ans = max(ans, dp(i + 1, True) - prices[i]) - fee
            else:
                # sell stock
                ans = max(ans, dp(i + 1, False) + prices[i])

            # do nothing
            ans = max(ans, dp(i + 1, is_holding))
            return ans

        return dp(0, False)
```

## Editorial

### Approach 1: Dynamic Programming

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int], fee: int) -> int:
        n = len(prices)
        hold, free = [0] * n, [0] * n

        # In order to hold a stock on day 0, we have no other choice but to buy it for prices[0].
        hold[0] = -prices[0]

        for i in range(1, n):
            hold[i] = max(hold[i - 1], free[i - 1] - prices[i])
            free[i] = max(free[i - 1], hold[i - 1] + prices[i] - fee)

        return free[-1]
```

### Approach 2: Space-Optimized Dynamic Programming

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int], fee: int) -> int:
        n = len(prices)
        hold, free = -prices[0], 0

        for i in range(1, n):
            tmp = hold
            hold = max(hold, free - prices[i])
            free = max(free, tmp + prices[i] - fee)

        return free
```
