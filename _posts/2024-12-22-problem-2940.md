## Problem Statement

![problem](/assets/images/2024-12-22_13-33-01-problem-2940.png)

## Brute Force [TLE]

```python
class Solution:
    def leftmostBuildingQueries(self, heights: List[int], queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        N = len(heights)
        res = []
        for alice, bob in queries:
            if alice > bob:
                alice, bob = bob, alice
            for left in range(bob, N):
                if alice == bob or heights[alice] < heights[bob]:
                    res.append(bob)
                    break
                if heights[left] > heights[alice] and heights[left] >= heights[bob]:
                    res.append(left)
                    break
            else:
                res.append(-1)
        return res
```

## Editorial Solution

### Approach 1: Monotonic Stack

1. **Prepare for Queries**:

   - Initialize a stack (`mono_stack`) to keep track of building heights in decreasing order.
   - Create a result array initialized with `-1` to store the answers for each query.
   - Group queries by their "b" value to process efficiently.

2. **Handle Simple Cases**:

   - For each query, if the height of building "b" is greater than building "a" (or if they are the same), directly assign `b` as the result.

3. **Process Complex Cases with Monotonic Stack**:

   - Traverse the `heights` array from right to left.
   - For each height, check pending queries:
     - Use binary search (`search` method) on the monotonic stack to find the appropriate leftmost building index for the current query.
   - Maintain the stack by removing heights smaller than the current height, ensuring it remains in decreasing order.

4. **Binary Search Helper**:
   - The `search` method is used to find the leftmost building taller than the given height using binary search on the stack.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:  
  $$O(n + q \cdot \log(n))$$  
  Where `n` is the number of buildings and `q` is the number of queries.
- **Space Complexity**:  
  $$O(n + q)$$  
  For storing the stack and grouped queries.

```python
class Solution:
    def leftmostBuildingQueries(self, heights, queries):
        mono_stack = []
        result = [-1 for _ in range(len(queries))]
        new_queries = [[] for _ in range(len(heights))]
        for i in range(len(queries)):
            a = queries[i][0]
            b = queries[i][1]
            if a > b:
                a, b = b, a
            if heights[b] > heights[a] or a == b:
                result[i] = b
            else:
                new_queries[b].append((heights[a], i))

        for i in range(len(heights) - 1, -1, -1):
            mono_stack_size = len(mono_stack)
            for a, b in new_queries[i]:
                position = self.search(a, mono_stack)
                if position < mono_stack_size and position >= 0:
                    result[b] = mono_stack[position][1]
            while mono_stack and mono_stack[-1][0] <= heights[i]:
                mono_stack.pop()
            mono_stack.append((heights[i], i))
        return result

    def search(self, height, mono_stack):
        left = 0
        right = len(mono_stack) - 1
        ans = -1
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if mono_stack[mid][0] > height:
                ans = max(ans, mid)
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        return ans
```
