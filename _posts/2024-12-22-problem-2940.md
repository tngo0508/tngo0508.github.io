## Problem Statement

![problem](/assets/images/2024-12-22_13-33-01-problem-2940.png)

## Brute Force [TLE]

```python
class Solution:
    def leftmostBuildingQueries(self, heights: List[int], queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        N = len(heights)
        res = []
        for alice, bob in queries:
            if alice > bob:
                alice, bob = bob, alice
            for left in range(bob, N):
                if alice == bob or heights[alice] < heights[bob]:
                    res.append(bob)
                    break
                if heights[left] > heights[alice] and heights[left] >= heights[bob]:
                    res.append(left)
                    break
            else:
                res.append(-1)
        return res
```

## Editorial Solution

### Approach 1: Monotonic Stack

1. **Prepare for Queries**:

   - Initialize a stack (`mono_stack`) to keep track of building heights in decreasing order.
   - Create a result array initialized with `-1` to store the answers for each query.
   - Group queries by their "b" value to process efficiently.

2. **Handle Simple Cases**:

   - For each query, if the height of building "b" is greater than building "a" (or if they are the same), directly assign `b` as the result.

3. **Process Complex Cases with Monotonic Stack**:

   - Traverse the `heights` array from right to left.
   - For each height, check pending queries:
     - Use binary search (`search` method) on the monotonic stack to find the appropriate leftmost building index for the current query.
   - Maintain the stack by removing heights smaller than the current height, ensuring it remains in decreasing order.

4. **Binary Search Helper**:
   - The `search` method is used to find the leftmost building taller than the given height using binary search on the stack.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:  
  $$O(n + q \cdot \log(n))$$  
  Where `n` is the number of buildings and `q` is the number of queries.
- **Space Complexity**:  
  $$O(n + q)$$  
  For storing the stack and grouped queries.

```python
class Solution:
    def leftmostBuildingQueries(self, heights, queries):
        mono_stack = []
        result = [-1 for _ in range(len(queries))]
        new_queries = [[] for _ in range(len(heights))]
        for i in range(len(queries)):
            a = queries[i][0]
            b = queries[i][1]
            if a > b:
                a, b = b, a
            if heights[b] > heights[a] or a == b:
                result[i] = b
            else:
                new_queries[b].append((heights[a], i))

        for i in range(len(heights) - 1, -1, -1):
            mono_stack_size = len(mono_stack)
            for a, b in new_queries[i]:
                position = self.search(a, mono_stack)
                if position < mono_stack_size and position >= 0:
                    result[b] = mono_stack[position][1]
            while mono_stack and mono_stack[-1][0] <= heights[i]:
                mono_stack.pop()
            mono_stack.append((heights[i], i))
        return result

    def search(self, height, mono_stack):
        left = 0
        right = len(mono_stack) - 1
        ans = -1
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if mono_stack[mid][0] > height:
                ans = max(ans, mid)
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        return ans
```

### Approach 2: Priority Queue

1. **Initialization**:

   - `max_idx`: A min-heap (priority queue) to store queries for efficient processing.
   - `results`: A list initialized with `-1` to store the result for each query.
   - `store_queries`: A list of lists, where each inner list stores queries associated with a specific building index.

2. **Preprocessing Queries**:

   - Iterate over each query `(a, b)`:
     - If one building's height is strictly less than the other and the order is satisfied (`heights[a] < heights[b]` or vice versa), directly assign the result.
     - If the heights are equal or no immediate result can be determined, store the query in `store_queries` based on the larger index of `a` or `b`.

3. **Processing Heights**:

   - Traverse the `heights` list:
     - **Resolve Pending Queries**:
       - While the smallest height in the heap (`max_idx[0]`) is less than the current building's height, it means the current building satisfies that query.
       - Pop such queries from the heap and assign the current index to the corresponding result in `results`.
     - **Add New Queries**:
       - Push queries from `store_queries[idx]` (associated with the current index) into the heap. Store them as tuples `(max(height_a, height_b), query_index)` for efficient processing.

4. **Return Results**:
   - After processing all heights and queries, return the `results` list.

```python
class Solution:
    def leftmostBuildingQueries(self, heights, queries):
        max_idx = []  # Min-heap to simulate priority queue
        results = [-1] * len(queries)
        store_queries = [[] for _ in heights]

        # Store the mappings for all queries in store_queries.
        for idx, query in enumerate(queries):
            a, b = query
            if a < b and heights[a] < heights[b]:
                results[idx] = b
            elif a > b and heights[a] > heights[b]:
                results[idx] = a
            elif a == b:
                results[idx] = a
            else:
                store_queries[max(a, b)].append(
                    (max(heights[a], heights[b]), idx)
                )

        for idx, height in enumerate(heights):
            # If the heap's smallest value is less than the current height, it is an answer to the query.
            while max_idx and max_idx[0][0] < height:
                _, q_idx = heapq.heappop(max_idx)
                results[q_idx] = idx
            # Push the queries with their maximum index as the current index into the heap.
            for element in store_queries[idx]:
                heapq.heappush(max_idx, element)

        return results
```
