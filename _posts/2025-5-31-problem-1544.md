## Problem Statement

[leetcode problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/make-the-string-great/description/)

## Stack Approach [Accepted]

```python
class Solution:
    def makeGood(self, s: str) -> str:
        stack = list(s)
        res = []
        res = []
        while stack:
            c = stack.pop()
            if res:
                top = res[-1]
                if (top.isupper() and top.lower() == c) \
                    or (top.islower() and top.upper() == c):
                    res.pop()
                    continue

            res.append(c)

        return ''.join(reversed(res))
```

## Editorial

### Approach 1: Iteration

```python
class Solution:
    def makeGood(self, s: str) -> str:
        # if s has less than 2 characters, we just return itself.
        while len(s) > 1:
            # 'find' records if we find any pair to remove.
            find = False

            # Check every two adjacent characters, curr_char and next_char.
            for i in range(len(s) - 1):
                curr_char, next_char = s[i], s[i + 1]

                # If they make a pair, remove them from 's' and let 'find = True'.
                if abs(ord(curr_char) - ord(next_char)) == 32:
                    s = s[:i] + s[i + 2:]
                    find = True
                    break

            # If we cannot find any pair to remove, break the loop.
            if not find:
                break
        return s
```

### Approach 2: Recursion

```python
class Solution:
    def makeGood(self, s: str) -> str:
        # If we find a pair in 's', remove this pair from 's'
        # and solve the remaining string recursively.
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if abs(ord(s[i]) - ord(s[i + 1])) == 32:
                return self.makeGood(s[:i] + s[i + 2:])

        # Base case, if we can't find a pair, just return 's'.
        return s
```

### Approach 3: Stack

```python
class Solution:
    def makeGood(self, s: str) -> str:
        # Use stack to store the visited characters.
        stack = []

        # Iterate over 's'.
        for curr_char in list(s):
            # If the current character make a pair with the last character in the stack,
            # remove both of them. Otherwise, we add the current character to stack.
            if stack and abs(ord(curr_char) - ord(stack[-1])) == 32:
                stack.pop()
            else:
                stack.append(curr_char)

        # Returns the string concatenated by all characters left in the stack.
        return "".join(stack)
```
