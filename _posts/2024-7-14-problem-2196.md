## Problem Statement

![2196](/assets/images/2024-07-14_18-50-35-2196.png)

## Intuition

My first thought is to parse through the list of descriptions and use a dictionary to keep track of all nodes by their values. This way, I can easily access and link each node to its parent or child as specified in the descriptions. I also need to keep track of all the children to identify the root node, which will be the one node that is never a child.

## Approach

1. **Initialize Structures**: I will use a dictionary `nodes` to store each node by its value. I'll also use a set `children` to keep track of all the nodes that are children.
2. **Process Descriptions**: For each description, I'll extract the parent, child, and whether the child is a left or right child. I'll create nodes for the parent and child if they don't already exist in the `nodes` dictionary.
3. **Link Nodes**: Depending on whether the child is a left or right child, I'll set the appropriate child link for the parent node.
4. **Identify the Root**: After processing all descriptions, I'll iterate through the keys in the `nodes` dictionary to find the node that is not in the `children` set. This node is the root.
5. **Return the Root**: Finally, I'll return the root node of the binary tree.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of descriptions. Each description is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of unique nodes. This space is used to store the nodes in the dictionary and the children in the set.

## Code

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def createBinaryTree(self, descriptions: List[List[int]]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        nodes = defaultdict(TreeNode)
        children = set()
        root = None

        for desc in descriptions:
            parent, child, isLeft = desc
            if parent not in nodes:
                nodes[parent] = TreeNode(parent)
            if child not in nodes:
                nodes[child] = TreeNode(child)
            if isLeft:
                nodes[parent].left = nodes[child]
            else:
                nodes[parent].right = nodes[child]

            children.add(child)

        for k in nodes.keys():
            if k not in children:
                root = nodes[k]
                break

        return root
```

### Approach 1: Convert to Graph with Breadth First Search

```python
class Solution:
    def createBinaryTree(
        self, descriptions: List[List[int]]
    ) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        # Sets to track unique children and parents
        children = set()
        parents = set()
        # Dictionary to store parent to children relationships
        parentToChildren = {}

        # Build graph from parent to child, and add nodes to sets
        for d in descriptions:
            parent, child, isLeft = d
            parents.add(parent)
            parents.add(child)
            children.add(child)
            if parent not in parentToChildren:
                parentToChildren[parent] = []
            parentToChildren[parent].append((child, isLeft))

        # Find the root node by checking which node is
        # in parents but not in children
        for parent in parents.copy():
            if parent in children:
                parents.remove(parent)

        root = TreeNode(next(iter(parents)))

        # Starting from root, use BFS to construct binary tree
        queue = deque([root])

        while queue:
            parent = queue.popleft()
            # Iterate over children of current parent
            for childValue, isLeft in parentToChildren.get(parent.val, []):
                child = TreeNode(childValue)
                queue.append(child)
                # Attach child node to its parent based on isLeft flag
                if isLeft == 1:
                    parent.left = child
                else:
                    parent.right = child

        return root
```

- time: O(n)
- space: O(n)

### Approach 2: Convert to Graph with Depth First Search

```python
class Solution:
    def createBinaryTree(
        self, descriptions: List[List[int]]
    ) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        # Step 1: Organize data
        parent_to_children = {}
        all_nodes = set()
        children = set()

        for parent, child, is_left in descriptions:
            # Store child information under parent node
            if parent not in parent_to_children:
                parent_to_children[parent] = []
            parent_to_children[parent].append((child, is_left))
            all_nodes.add(parent)
            all_nodes.add(child)
            children.add(child)

        # Step 2: Find the root
        root_val = (all_nodes - children).pop()

        # Step 3 & 4: Build the tree using DFS
        def _dfs(val):
            # Create new TreeNode for current value
            node = TreeNode(val)

            # If current node has children, recursively build them
            if val in parent_to_children:
                for child, is_left in parent_to_children[val]:
                    # Attach child node based on is_left flag
                    if is_left:
                        node.left = _dfs(child)
                    else:
                        node.right = _dfs(child)
            return node

        return _dfs(root_val)
```

### Approach 3: Constructing Tree From Directly Map and TreeNode Object

```python
class Solution:
    def createBinaryTree(
        self, descriptions: List[List[int]]
    ) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        # Maps values to TreeNode pointers
        node_map = {}

        # Stores values which are children in the descriptions
        children = set()

        # Iterate through description to create nodes and set up tree structure
        for description in descriptions:
            # Extract parent value, child value, and whether
            # it is a left child (1) or right child (0)
            parent_value = description[0]
            child_value = description[1]
            is_left = bool(description[2])

            # Create parent and child nodes if not already created
            if parent_value not in node_map:
                node_map[parent_value] = TreeNode(parent_value)
            if child_value not in node_map:
                node_map[child_value] = TreeNode(child_value)

            # Attach child node to parent's left or right branch
            if is_left:
                node_map[parent_value].left = node_map[child_value]
            else:
                node_map[parent_value].right = node_map[child_value]

            # Mark child as a child in the set
            children.add(child_value)

        # Find and return the root node
        for node in node_map.values():
            if node.val not in children:
                return node  # Root node found

        return None  # Should not occur according to problem statement
```
