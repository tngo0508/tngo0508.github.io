## Problem

![problem-1907](/assets/images/2024-02-29_21-09-59-problem-1907.png)

Note:

>The main difference between **UNION** vs **UNION ALL** is their approach to duplicate rows. After **UNION** combines datasets, it also checks for duplicate records and removes them. **UNION ALL** only combines them and stops there.

## Query

```sql
(
    SELECT "Low Salary" as category, COUNT(income) AS accounts_count
    FROM Accounts
    WHERE income < 20000
)
UNION ALL
(
    SELECT "Average Salary" as category, COUNT(income) AS accounts_count
    FROM Accounts
    WHERE income BETWEEN 20000 AND 50000
)
UNION ALL
(
    SELECT "High Salary" as category, COUNT(income) AS accounts_count
    FROM Accounts
    WHERE income > 50000
)

```

## Editorial Solution

```sql
SELECT
    'Low Salary' AS category,
    SUM(CASE WHEN income < 20000 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS accounts_count
FROM
    Accounts

UNION
SELECT
    'Average Salary' category,
    SUM(CASE WHEN income >= 20000 AND income <= 50000 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
    AS accounts_count
FROM
    Accounts

UNION
SELECT
    'High Salary' category,
    SUM(CASE WHEN income > 50000 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS accounts_count
FROM
    Accounts
```
