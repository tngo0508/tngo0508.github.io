## Problem Statement

![problem](/assets/images/2024-11-28_13-28-39-problem-2290.png)

Notes:

- need to review Dijstra and BFS 0-1 approach
- set to inf on empty cell

## Editorial

### Approach 1: Dijkstra's Algorithm

```python
class Solution:
    # Directions for movement: right, left, down, up
    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]

    def minimumObstacles(self, grid):
        # Helper method to check if the cell is within the grid bounds
        def _is_valid(row, col):
            return 0 <= row < len(grid) and 0 <= col < len(grid[0])

        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])

        # Initialize distance matrix with infinity (large value)
        min_obstacles = [[float("inf")] * n for _ in range(m)]

        # Start from the top-left corner, accounting for its obstacle value
        min_obstacles[0][0] = grid[0][0]

        pq = [(min_obstacles[0][0], 0, 0)]  # (obstacles, row, col)

        while pq:
            obstacles, row, col = heapq.heappop(pq)

            # If we've reached the bottom-right corner, return the result
            if row == m - 1 and col == n - 1:
                return obstacles

            # Explore all four possible directions from the current cell
            for dr, dc in self.directions:
                new_row, new_col = row + dr, col + dc

                if _is_valid(new_row, new_col):
                    # Calculate the obstacles removed if moving to the new cell
                    new_obstacles = obstacles + grid[new_row][new_col]

                    # Update if we've found a path with fewer obstacles to the new cell
                    if new_obstacles < min_obstacles[new_row][new_col]:
                        min_obstacles[new_row][new_col] = new_obstacles
                        heapq.heappush(pq, (new_obstacles, new_row, new_col))

        return min_obstacles[m - 1][n - 1]
```

### Approach 2: 0-1 Breadth-First Search (BFS)

```python
class Solution:
    # Directions for movement: right, left, down, up
    _directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]

    def minimumObstacles(self, grid):
        # Helper method to check if the cell is within the grid bounds
        def _is_valid(row, col):
            return 0 <= row < len(grid) and 0 <= col < len(grid[0])

        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])

        # Distance matrix to store the minimum obstacles removed to reach each cell
        min_obstacles = [[float("inf")] * n for _ in range(m)]
        min_obstacles[0][0] = 0

        deque_cells = deque([(0, 0, 0)])  # (obstacles, row, col)

        while deque_cells:
            obstacles, row, col = deque_cells.popleft()

            # Explore all four possible directions from the current cell
            for dr, dc in self._directions:
                new_row, new_col = row + dr, col + dc

                if _is_valid(new_row, new_col) and min_obstacles[new_row][
                    new_col
                ] == float("inf"):
                    if grid[new_row][new_col] == 1:
                        # If it's an obstacle, add 1 to obstacles and push to the back
                        min_obstacles[new_row][new_col] = obstacles + 1
                        deque_cells.append((obstacles + 1, new_row, new_col))
                    else:
                        # If it's an empty cell, keep the obstacle count and push to the front
                        min_obstacles[new_row][new_col] = obstacles
                        deque_cells.appendleft((obstacles, new_row, new_col))

        return min_obstacles[m - 1][n - 1]
```
