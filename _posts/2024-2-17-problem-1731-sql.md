## Problem

![problem-1731](/assets/images/2024-02-17_13-25-21-problem-1731.png)

## Query

The idea is to do the inner join on the table itself first in order to get the following table. Each row will contain the manager id and the employee id that the manager is supervising.

```sql
SELECT 
    *
FROM
    Employees AS e1
INNER JOIN
    Employees AS e2
    ON
        e1.employee_id = e2.reports_to
```

Result:

| employee_id | name  | reports_to | age | employee_id | name  | reports_to | age |
| ----------- | ----- | ---------- | --- | ----------- | ----- | ---------- | --- |
| 9           | Hercy | null       | 43  | 6           | Alice | 9          | 41  |
| 9           | Hercy | null       | 43  | 4           | Bob   | 9          | 36  |

After we apply the necessary aggregate functions to get the final result

```sql
SELECT 
    e1.employee_id,
    e1.name,
    COUNT(e2.employee_id) AS 'reports_count',
    ROUND(AVG(e2.age * 1.0), 0) AS 'average_age'
FROM
    Employees AS e1
INNER JOIN
    Employees AS e2
    ON
        e1.employee_id = e2.reports_to
GROUP BY
    e1.employee_id, e1.name
ORDER BY
    e1.employee_id
```
