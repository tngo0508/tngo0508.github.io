Today, I dedicated an hour to reading "Mindset: The New Psychology of Success" by Carol S. Dweck. In essence, the author elucidates the distinction between a fixed mindset and a growth mindset. Individuals with a fixed mindset are prone to giving up easily, letting fate dictate their path. Conversely, those with a growth mindset tend to thrive and overcome life's challenges.

As I delved into the book, I realized I had harbored a fixed mindset, unquestioningly accepting others' judgments without considering my own potential or intelligence. Now armed with this insight, I aspire to gradually shift towards a growth mindset, enabling me to hold my head high and steer clear of depression.
