## Problem Statement

![237](/assets/images/2024-05-05_09-21-11-problem-237.png)

## Intuition

The intuition here appears to be to delete the given node by modifying its value and next pointer to mimic the effect of deleting it.

## Approach

Since we are not given `head` node in the singly-linked list. We need to do the following procedure:

- The function takes in a node as input, which is the node to be deleted.
- It first assigns the current node to `curr`.
- Then it assigns the next node of `curr` to `next_node`.
- It updates the `next` pointer of `curr` to point to the node after `next_node`.
- Finally, it updates the value of `curr` to the value of `next_node`, effectively mimicking the deletion of `next_node`.

## Complexity

- Time complexity:
  O(1)

- Space complexity:
  O(1)

## Code

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def deleteNode(self, node):
        """
        :type node: ListNode
        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify node in-place instead.
        """
        curr = node
        next_node = curr.next
        curr.next = next_node.next
        curr.val = next_node.val
```

## Editorial Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def deleteNode(self, node):
        # Overwrite data of next node on current node.
        node.val = node.next.val
        # Make current node point to next of next node.
        node.next = node.next.next
```
