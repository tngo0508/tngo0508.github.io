## Problem Statement

![problem](/assets/images/2024-09-15_19-33-01-problem-1257.png)

## Intuition

The problem can be framed as finding the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two regions in a tree-like structure, where each node represents a region, and its child nodes represent the regions within it. This suggests a recursive approach where we explore the region hierarchy to find the smallest common region.

## Approach

1. **Graph Representation**: First, we represent the regions as a directed graph where each region points to its subregions.
2. **Recursive Search for LCA**: We define a recursive function to find the LCA. Starting from the root region, for each subregion, we check if it contains either of the two regions (`region1` or `region2`). If a region contains both target regions in its subtree, it becomes the lowest common ancestor.
3. **Handling Base Cases**: The base case for the recursion is when the current region is one of the target regions (`region1` or `region2`), which is returned upwards through the recursive calls.
4. **Track the Result**: As we traverse the graph, we track whether we've found a region that satisfies the condition of being the LCA.

## Complexity

- Time complexity:
  $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the number of regions. This is because we traverse the entire graph once to construct it and then traverse it again in a depth-first manner to find the LCA.

- Space complexity:
  $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the number of regions. This is due to the space used by the recursion stack and the adjacency list representation of the graph.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def __init__(self):
        self.ans = None

    def find_lowest_common_ancestor(self, graph, q, p, curr):
        foundedRegions = []
        found = curr == q or curr == p
        for node in graph[curr]:
            foundedRegions.append(self.find_lowest_common_ancestor(graph, q, p, node))

        if (found and any(foundedRegions)) or (sum(foundedRegions) >= 2):
            self.ans = curr

        return any(foundedRegions) or found

    def findSmallestRegion(self, regions: List[List[str]], region1: str, region2: str) -> str:
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        for region in regions:
            graph[region[0]] = region[1:]
        self.find_lowest_common_ancestor(graph, region1, region2, regions[0][0])
        return self.ans
```

## Editorial

### Approach: Lowest Common Ancestor of a Generic Tree

```python
class Solution:
    # Function to return a list representing the path from the root node
    # to the current node.
    def fetch_path_for_region(self, curr_node, child_parent_map):
        path = []
        # Start by adding the current node to the path.
        path.append(curr_node)

        # Traverse upwards through the tree by finding the parent of the
        # current node. Continue until the root node is reached.
        while curr_node in child_parent_map:
            parent_node = child_parent_map[curr_node]
            path.append(parent_node)
            curr_node = parent_node

        # Reverse the path so that it starts from the root and
        # ends at the given current node.
        path.reverse()
        return path

    def findSmallestRegion(
        self, regions: List[List[str]], region1: str, region2: str
    ) -> str:
        # Dictionary to store (child -> parent) relationships for each region.
        child_parent_map = {}

        # Populate the 'child_parent_map' using the provided 'regions' list.
        for region_array in regions:
            parent_node = region_array[0]
            for i in range(1, len(region_array)):
                child_parent_map[region_array[i]] = parent_node

        # Store the paths from the root node to 'region1' and 'region2'
        # nodes in their respective lists.
        path1 = self.fetch_path_for_region(region1, child_parent_map)
        path2 = self.fetch_path_for_region(region2, child_parent_map)

        i, j = 0, 0
        lowest_common_ancestor = ""
        # Traverse both paths simultaneously until the paths diverge.
        # The last common node is the lowest common ancestor.
        while i < len(path1) and j < len(path2) and path1[i] == path2[j]:
            lowest_common_ancestor = path1[i]
            i += 1
            j += 1

        # Return the lowest common ancestor of 'region1' and 'region2'.
        return lowest_common_ancestor
```
