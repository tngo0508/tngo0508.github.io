## Problem Statement

[leetcode problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-the-middle-node-of-a-linked-list/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)

## My Solution [Accepted]

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def deleteMiddle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        sentinel = ListNode(-1, head)
        slow = sentinel
        fast = sentinel.next
        middleNode = slow.next
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
            middleNode = slow.next

        prev = sentinel
        curr = head
        while curr is not None:
            if curr is middleNode:
                prev.next = curr.next
                break
            prev = curr
            curr = curr.next

        return sentinel.next

```

## Editorial

### Approach 1: 2 Passes

```python
class Solution:
    def deleteMiddle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # Edge case: return None if there is only one node.
        if head.next == None:
            return None

        count = 0
        p1 = p2 = head

        # First pass, count the number of nodes in the linked list using 'p1'.
        while p1:
            count += 1
            p1 = p1.next

        # Get the index of the node to be deleted.
        middle_index = count // 2

        # Second pass, let 'p2' move toward the predecessor of the middle node.
        for _ in range(middle_index - 1):
            p2 = p2.next

        # Delete the middle node and return 'head'.
        p2.next = p2.next.next
        return head
```

### Approach 2: Fast and Slow Pointers

```python
class Solution:
    def deleteMiddle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # Edge case: return None if there is only one node.
        if head.next == None:
            return None

        # Initialize two pointers, 'slow' and 'fast'.
        slow, fast = head, head.next.next

        # Let 'fast' move forward by 2 nodes, 'slow' move forward by 1 node each step.
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

        # When 'fast' reaches the end, remove the next node of 'slow' and return 'head'.
        slow.next = slow.next.next

        # The job is done, return 'head'.
        return head
```
