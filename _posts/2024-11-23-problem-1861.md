## Problem Statement

![problem](/assets/images/2024-11-23_14-43-03-problem-1861.png)

## Intuition

The problem requires simulating gravity to drop stones (`'#'`) as far right as possible within the constraints of the obstacles (`'*'`). Once the stones are settled, the box needs to be rotated 90 degrees clockwise. Breaking the task into two steps—gravity simulation and rotation—makes the solution manageable.

## Approach

### Step 1: Simulating Gravity

1. Traverse each row in the box to count stones (`'#'`).
2. When encountering an obstacle (`'*'`) or reaching the end of the row, push the stones as far right as possible while leaving spaces (`'.'`) in the original positions.
3. Maintain a stack to handle any leftover stones at the end of the row.

### Step 2: Rotating the Box

1. Create a new 2D array to represent the rotated box, where the dimensions are swapped (rows become columns and vice versa).
2. Populate the new array by iterating through the original box and transferring elements to their respective positions in the rotated version.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**

  - Simulating gravity takes $$O(R \times C)$$ because each element in the box is processed once.
  - Rotating the box also takes $$O(R \times C)$$ since every element is copied into the new array.  
    Hence, the total time complexity is $$O(R \times C)$$.

- **Space Complexity:**
  - The rotated box requires $$O(R \times C)$$ additional space.
  - Other auxiliary storage, such as the stack, is negligible.  
    Thus, the space complexity is $$O(R \times C)$$.

## Code

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def rotateTheBox(self, box: List[List[str]]) -> List[List[str]]:
        ROWS = len(box)
        COLS = len(box[0])
        STONE = '#'
        EMPTY = '.'
        BLOCK = '*'
        res = []

        # Initialize the rotated box with empty spaces
        for col in range(COLS):
            arr = []
            for row in range(ROWS):
                arr.append(EMPTY)
            res.append(arr)

        # Simulate gravity in each row
        for r in range(ROWS):
            stones = 0
            stack = []
            for c in range(COLS):
                if box[r][c] == STONE:
                    stones += 1
                    box[r][c] = EMPTY
                if box[r][c] == BLOCK and stones > 0:
                    stack.append([c, stones])
                    stones = 0

            if stones > 0:
                stack.append([COLS, stones])

            while stack:
                col, left_stones = stack.pop()
                for cc in range(col - 1, -1, -1):
                    box[r][cc] = STONE
                    left_stones -= 1
                    if left_stones == 0:
                        break

        # Rotate the box 90 degrees clockwise
        for row in range(ROWS):
            for col in range(COLS):
                value = box[row][col]
                res[col][ROWS - row - 1] = value

        return res
```

## Revised Code

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def rotateTheBox(self, box: List[List[str]]) -> List[List[str]]:
        ROWS = len(box)
        COLS = len(box[0])
        STONE = '#'
        EMPTY = '.'
        BLOCK = '*'

        # Simulate gravity within each row
        for r in range(ROWS):
            stones = 0
            for c in range(COLS):
                if box[r][c] == STONE:
                    stones += 1
                    box[r][c] = EMPTY
                if box[r][c] == BLOCK:
                    for cc in range(c - 1, c - stones - 1, -1):
                        box[r][cc] = STONE
                    stones = 0
            # Handle remaining stones after the last obstacle
            for cc in range(COLS - 1, COLS - stones - 1, -1):
                box[r][cc] = STONE

        # Rotate the box 90 degrees clockwise
        rotated_box = [[EMPTY for _ in range(ROWS)] for _ in range(COLS)]
        for row in range(ROWS):
            for col in range(COLS):
                rotated_box[col][ROWS - row - 1] = box[row][col]

        return rotated_box
```

## Editorial Solution

### Approach 1: Row by Row (Brute Force)

```python
class Solution:
    def rotateTheBox(self, box: List[List[str]]) -> List[List[str]]:
        m = len(box)
        n = len(box[0])
        result = [["" for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]

        # Create the transpose of the input grid in `result`
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                result[i][j] = box[j][i]

        # Reverse each row in the transpose grid to complete the 90° rotation
        for i in range(n):
            result[i].reverse()

        # Apply gravity to let stones fall to the lowest possible empty cell in each column
        for j in range(m):
            # Process each cell in column `j` from bottom to top
            for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
                if (
                    result[i][j] == "."
                ):  # Found an empty cell; check if a stone can fall into it
                    next_row_with_stone = -1

                    # Look for a stone directly above the empty cell `result[i][j]`
                    for k in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
                        if result[k][j] == "*":
                            break  # Obstacle blocks any stones above
                        if (
                            result[k][j] == "#"
                        ):  # Stone found with no obstacles in between
                            next_row_with_stone = k
                            break

                    # If a stone was found above, let it fall into the empty cell `result[i][j]`
                    if next_row_with_stone != -1:
                        result[next_row_with_stone][j] = "."
                        result[i][j] = "#"

        return result
```

- time: O(m\*n^2)
- space: O(m\*n)

### Approach 2: Row By Row (Optimized)

```python
class Solution:
    def rotateTheBox(self, box: List[List[str]]) -> List[List[str]]:
        m = len(box)
        n = len(box[0])
        result = [["" for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]

        # Create the transpose of the input grid in `result`
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                result[i][j] = box[j][i]

        # Reverse each row in the transpose grid to complete the 90° rotation
        for i in range(n):
            result[i].reverse()

        # Apply gravity to let stones fall to the lowest possible empty cell in each column
        for j in range(m):
            lowest_row_with_empty_cell = n - 1
            # Process each cell in column `j` from bottom to top
            for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
                # Found a stone - let it fall to the lowest empty cell
                if result[i][j] == "#":
                    result[i][j] = "."
                    result[lowest_row_with_empty_cell][j] = "#"
                    lowest_row_with_empty_cell -= 1
                # Found an obstacle - reset `lowest_row_with_empty_cell` to the row directly above it
                if result[i][j] == "*":
                    lowest_row_with_empty_cell = i - 1

        return result
```

- time: O(m\*n)
- space: O(m\*n)

### Approach 3: Combine rotation and gravity operations

```python
class Solution:
    def rotateTheBox(self, box):
        m = len(box)
        n = len(box[0])
        result = [["." for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]

        # Apply gravity to let stones fall to the lowest possible empty cell in each column
        for i in range(m):
            lowest_row_with_empty_cell = n - 1
            # Process each cell in row `i` in reversed order
            for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
                # Found a stone - let it fall to the lowest empty cell
                if box[i][j] == "#":
                    # Place it in the correct position in the rotated grid
                    result[lowest_row_with_empty_cell][m - i - 1] = "#"
                    lowest_row_with_empty_cell -= 1
                # Found an obstacle - reset `lowest_row_with_empty_cell` to the row directly above it
                if box[i][j] == "*":
                    # Place the obstacle in the correct position in the rotated grid
                    result[j][m - i - 1] = "*"
                    lowest_row_with_empty_cell = j - 1

        return result
```
