## Problem Statement

![problem](/assets/images/2025-01-12_17-58-13-problem-3223.jpg)

## Count Approach

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumLength(self, s: str) -> int:
        counter = Counter(s)
        res = 0
        for c, count in counter.items():
            while count >= 3:
                count -= 2
            res += count
        return res
```

## Editorial

### Approach 1: Using Hash Map

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumLength(self, s: str) -> int:
        # Step 1: Count the frequency of each character in the string
        char_frequency_map = Counter(s)

        # Step 2: Calculate the number of characters to delete
        delete_count = 0
        for frequency in char_frequency_map.values():
            if frequency % 2 == 1:
                # If frequency is odd, delete all except one
                delete_count += frequency - 1
            else:
                # If frequency is even, delete all except two
                delete_count += frequency - 2

        # Step 3: Return the minimum length after deletions
        return len(s) - delete_count
```

### Approach 2: Using Frequency Array

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumLength(self, s: str) -> int:
        # Step 1: Initialize a frequency array to count occurrences of each character
        char_frequency = [0] * 26
        total_length = 0

        # Step 2: Count the frequency of each character in the string
        for current_char in s:
            char_frequency[ord(current_char) - ord("a")] += 1

        # Step 3: Calculate the total length after deletions count
        for frequency in char_frequency:
            if frequency == 0:
                continue  # Skip characters that don't appear
            if frequency % 2 == 0:
                total_length += 2  # If frequency is even, add 2 characters
            else:
                total_length += 1  # If frequency is odd, add 1 character

        # Step 4: Return the minimum length after deletions count
        return total_length
```
