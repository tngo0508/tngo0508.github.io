## Problem Statement

![problem-1325](/assets/images/2024-05-16_22-47-14-problem-1325.png)

## Intuition

To solve the problem of removing leaf nodes with a specific target value from a binary tree, we need to recursively check each node's children. If a node becomes a leaf node and its value equals the target value, we need to remove it. This removal process should continue until no such nodes remain.

## Approach

- Recursive Traversal: Traverse the tree using post-order traversal (left, right, root) because we need to handle the children before their parent. This ensures that we can safely remove leaf nodes and check if their parent becomes a leaf node after their removal.
- Remove Leaf Nodes: If a node is a leaf node and its value is equal to the target value, we can remove it by returning None from the recursive call.
- Return Updated Tree: The final tree is returned after all necessary removals.

## Complexity

- Time complexity:
  O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree

- Space complexity:
  O(h) where h is the height of the tree

## Code

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def removeLeafNodes(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], target: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        def helper(node):
            if not node:
                return

            L = helper(node.left)
            R = helper(node.right)
            if node.val == target:
                if not L and not R:
                    node.val = 'x'
                if not L and R and R.val == 'x':
                    node.val = 'x'
                if L and L.val == 'x' and not R:
                    node.val = 'x'
                if L and R and L.val == 'x' and R.val == 'x':
                    node.val = 'x'
            return node

        def delete_node(node):
            if not node:
                return

            if node.left and node.left.val == 'x':
                node.left = None
            if node.right and node.right.val == 'x':
                node.right = None

            delete_node(node.left)
            delete_node(node.right)


        helper(root)
        delete_node(root)

        return root if root.val != 'x' else None
```
