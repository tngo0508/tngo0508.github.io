## Problem Statement

![problem](/assets/images/2024-08-27_21-32-48-problem-1905.png)

## Intuition

When I first encountered this problem, I realized that I needed to determine if an island in the second grid is fully contained within an island in the first grid. My initial thought was to explore each island in the second grid and check its corresponding area in the first grid.

## Approach

My approach was to use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore each island in the second grid. For each island, I marked the visited cells to avoid redundant work. As I explored an island in `grid2`, I checked if every cell in this island corresponded to a land cell in `grid1`. If even one cell in `grid2` corresponded to a water cell in `grid1`, I disregarded that island. If all cells matched, I counted it as a valid sub-island.

## Complexity

- Time complexity:
  The time complexity is $$O(n \times m)$$, where `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the number of columns in the grid. This is because in the worst case, we might need to visit every cell in `grid2`.

- Space complexity:
  The space complexity is also $$O(n \times m)$$ due to the space needed for the BFS queue, which in the worst case could store all cells.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def countSubIslands(self, grid1: List[List[int]], grid2: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        ROWS = len(grid1)
        COLS = len(grid1[0])
        sub_islands = 0
        direction = [(0,1),(-1,0),(0,-1),(1,0)]

        def bfs(r, c, grid_1, grid_2):
            queue = deque([[r,c]])
            other_queue = deque([[r,c]])
            grid_2[r][c] = 2
            while queue:
                curr_row, curr_col = queue.popleft()
                other_queue.append([curr_row, curr_col])
                for x, y in direction:
                    next_row, next_col = curr_row + x, curr_col + y
                    if 0 <= next_row < ROWS and 0 <= next_col < COLS and grid_2[next_row][next_col] == 1:
                        queue.append([next_row, next_col])
                        grid_2[next_row][next_col] = 2

            while other_queue:
                row, col = other_queue.popleft()
                if grid_1[row][col] != 1:
                    return 0

            return 1

        for row in range(ROWS):
            for col in range(COLS):
                if grid2[row][col] == 1 and grid1[row][col] == 1:
                    sub_islands += bfs(row, col, grid1, grid2)

        return sub_islands
```

### Approach 1: Breadth-First Search (BFS)

                # starting from this cell is a sub-island in 'grid1', then we
