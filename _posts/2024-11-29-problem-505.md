## Problem Statement

![problem](/assets/images/2024-11-29_15-49-24-problem-505.png)

- Note: using Dijkstra's algorithm

## Intuition

The problem requires finding the shortest distance from the starting point to the destination in a maze. The key insight is that the ball keeps rolling in one direction until it hits a wall, making this a variation of the shortest-path problem. Using a priority queue allows us to explore the shortest paths first, similar to Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Approach

1. **Initialization**:

   - Store the number of rows (`ROWS`) and columns (`COLS`) of the maze.
   - Create a `distances` matrix initialized to infinity (`float('inf')`) for all cells except the start cell, which is initialized to 0.
   - Define the four possible movement directions as `(down, up, right, left)`.

2. **Priority Queue**:

   - Use a priority queue (min-heap) to keep track of the cell coordinates and the distance traveled to reach them.

3. **Iterative Search**:

   - While the priority queue is not empty:
     - Pop the cell with the smallest distance from the queue.
     - For each direction:
       - Roll the ball in that direction until it hits a wall or boundary.
       - Calculate the distance traveled in this direction.
       - If the new distance is shorter than the currently recorded distance for the stopping cell, update it and add the cell to the priority queue.

4. **Return Result**:
   - After processing all reachable cells, check the `distances` value for the destination cell.
   - If it is still infinity, return `-1` (unreachable); otherwise, return the shortest distance.

## Complexity

- **Time complexity**:
  $$O(m \cdot n \cdot \log(m \cdot n))$$

  - Each cell can be processed once, and for each cell, we push/pull from the priority queue which takes $$O(\log(m \cdot n))$$ operations.

- **Space complexity**:
  $$O(m \cdot n)$$
  - We use a `distances` matrix and a priority queue that can hold up to $$m \cdot n$$ elements in the worst case.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def shortestDistance(self, maze: List[List[int]], start: List[int], destination: List[int]) -> int:
        ROWS = len(maze)
        COLS = len(maze[0])
        distances = [[float('inf') for _ in range(COLS)] for _ in range(ROWS)]
        distances[start[0]][start[1]] = 0
        directions = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]
        priority_queue = [[start[0], start[1], 0]]
        while priority_queue:
            row, col, distance = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)
            if distances[row][col] < distance:
                continue

            for dx, dy in directions:
                nr, nc = row + dx, col + dy
                curr_distance = 0
                while 0 <= nr < ROWS and 0 <= nc < COLS and maze[nr][nc] == 0:
                    nr, nc = nr + dx, nc + dy
                    curr_distance += 1

                new_distance = distances[row][col] + curr_distance
                if distances[nr - dx][nc - dy] > new_distance:
                    distances[nr - dx][nc - dy] = new_distance
                    heapq.heappush(priority_queue, [nr - dx, nc - dy, new_distance])

        res = distances[destination[0]][destination[1]]
        return res if res != float('inf') else -1
```
