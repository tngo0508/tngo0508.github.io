## Problem Statement

![1545](/assets/images/2024-10-19_12-57-29-problem-1545.png)

## Intuition

The problem can be understood as generating a recursive sequence of strings, where each string is constructed based on the previous one by inverting the characters of the previous string and appending it in reverse with a '1' in the middle. Our goal is to efficiently construct this sequence and retrieve the k-th bit in the n-th string.

## Approach

The approach involves two main tasks:

1. **Recursive String Generation**:

   - We define a helper function `helper(n)` to generate the n-th string in the sequence. The first string, `S1`, is simply "0".
   - For each subsequent string `Si`, we generate it by concatenating the previous string `Si-1`, a "1", and the reverse of `Si-1` with all bits inverted.
   - We recursively generate the previous string until we reach `S1`.

2. **Finding the k-th Bit**:
   - Once the n-th string is generated using the helper function, we directly access the k-th bit by indexing into the string (adjusted for 0-based indexing).

## Complexity

- **Time complexity**:

  - The time complexity of generating the n-th string recursively is $$O(2^n)$$ because at each level, the string doubles in size.
  - Finding the k-th bit takes constant time $$O(1)$$ once the string is generated.
  - Thus, the overall time complexity is $$O(2^n)$$.

- **Space complexity**:
  - The space complexity is also $$O(2^n)$$, due to the storage of the generated string and the recursive function stack.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def helper(self, n):
        if n == 1:
            return '0'
        s_i = self.helper(n - 1)
        s_i_invert = []
        for x in s_i:
            if x == '1': s_i_invert.append('0')
            else: s_i_invert.append('1')
        return s_i + "1" + ''.join(reversed(s_i_invert))

    def findKthBit(self, n: int, k: int) -> str:
        convert_string = self.helper(n)
        return convert_string[k - 1]
```

## Editorial

### Approach 1: Brute Force

```python
class Solution:
    def findKthBit(self, n: int, k: int) -> str:
        sequence = "0"

        # Generate sequence until we have enough elements or reach nth iteration
        for i in range(1, n):
            if k <= len(sequence):
                break
            sequence += "1"

            # Append the inverted and reversed part of the existing sequence
            inverted = "".join(
                "1" if bit == "0" else "0" for bit in sequence[:-1]
            )
            sequence += inverted[::-1]

        # Return the kth bit
        return sequence[k - 1]
```

### Approach 2: Recursion

```python
class Solution:
    def findKthBit(self, n: int, k: int) -> str:
        # Base case: for S1, return '0'
        if n == 1:
            return "0"

        # Calculate the length of Sn
        length = 1 << n  # Equivalent to 2^n

        # If k is in the first half of the string, recurse with n-1
        if k < length // 2:
            return self.findKthBit(n - 1, k)

        # If k is exactly in the middle, return '1'
        elif k == length // 2:
            return "1"

        # If k is in the second half of the string
        else:
            # Find the corresponding bit in the first half and invert it
            corresponding_bit = self.findKthBit(n - 1, length - k)
            return "1" if corresponding_bit == "0" else "0"
```

## Approach 3: Iterative Divide and Conquer

```python
class Solution:
    def findKthBit(self, n: int, k: int) -> str:
        invert_count = 0
        len = (1 << n) - 1  # Length of Sn is 2^n - 1

        while k > 1:
            # If k is in the middle, return based on inversion count
            if k == len // 2 + 1:
                return "1" if invert_count % 2 == 0 else "0"

            # If k is in the second half, invert and mirror
            if k > len // 2:
                k = len + 1 - k  # Mirror position
                invert_count += 1  # Increment inversion count

            len //= 2  # Reduce length for next iteration

        # For the first position, return based on inversion count
        return "0" if invert_count % 2 == 0 else "1"
```
