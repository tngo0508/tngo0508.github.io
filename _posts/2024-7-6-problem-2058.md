## Problem Statement

![2058](/assets/images/2024-07-06_09-17-40-problem2582.png)

## Intuition

The problem can be visualized as people standing in a line, passing a pillow back and forth. We need to determine which person has the pillow after a given amount of time `time`.

## Approach

1. **Initialization**:

   - Start at the first person, `i = 1`.
   - Use a boolean flag `isLeftToRight` to track the direction of the pillow passing (left-to-right or right-to-left).

2. **Simulate Passing the Pillow**:

   - Continue the process until the given time runs out.
   - If the current direction is left-to-right (`isLeftToRight` is `True`):
     - Increment the position `i`.
     - If the pillow reaches the last person (`i == n`), change direction.
   - If the current direction is right-to-left (`isLeftToRight` is `False`):
     - Decrement the position `i`.
     - If the pillow reaches the first person (`i == 1`), change direction.

3. **Return the Final Position**:
   - After the loop finishes, the current value of `i` will be the person who has the pillow.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:
  - The loop runs `time` times, making the time complexity \(O(\text{time})\).
- **Space Complexity**:
  - Only a few variables are used regardless of input size, making the space complexity \(O(1)\).

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def passThePillow(self, n: int, time: int) -> int:
        i = 1
        isLeftToRight = True
        while time > 0:
            if isLeftToRight:
                i += 1
                if i == n:
                    isLeftToRight = not isLeftToRight
            else:
                i -= 1
                if i == 1:
                    isLeftToRight = not isLeftToRight
            time -= 1

        return i
```

## Editorial

### Approach 1: Simulation

```python
class Solution:
    def passThePillow(self, n: int, time: int) -> int:
        current_pillow_position = 1
        current_time = 0
        direction = 1
        while current_time < time:
            if 0 < current_pillow_position + direction <= n:
                current_pillow_position += direction
                current_time += 1
            else:
                # Reverse the direction if the next position is out of bounds
                direction *= -1
        return current_pillow_position
```

### Math

```python
class Solution:
    def passThePillow(self, n, time):
        # Calculate the number of complete rounds of pillow passing
        full_rounds = time // (n - 1)

        # Calculate the remaining time after complete rounds
        extra_time = time % (n - 1)

        # Determine the position of the person holding the pillow
        # If full_rounds is even, the pillow is moving forward.
        # If full_rounds is odd, the pillow is moving backward.
        if full_rounds % 2 == 0:
            return extra_time + 1  # Position when moving forward
        else:
            return n - extra_time  # Position when moving backward
```
