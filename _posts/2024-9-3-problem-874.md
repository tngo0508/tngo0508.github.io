## Problem

![problem](/assets/images/2024-09-03_20-18-08-problem874.png)

## Intuition

<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->

The robot is controlled by a sequence of commands and should avoid obstacles. We need to simulate its movement step by step, keeping track of its position and direction, while checking for obstacles.

## Approach

<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->

We start with the robot at position `(0, 0)` facing north. We can use a set to store obstacles for O(1) lookup. The robot's movement direction can be controlled by a set of booleans (north, south, west, east), which change based on the left and right turns.

For every movement command:

1. If the command is a turn (`LEFT` or `RIGHT`), we update the direction accordingly.
2. If the command is a forward move, we check each step until either the number of steps is completed or the robot encounters an obstacle.

We calculate the square of the Euclidean distance from the origin for each new position and track the maximum distance the robot reaches.

## Complexity

- Time complexity:  
  The time complexity is $$O(k + n)$$, where $$k$$ is the number of commands and $$n$$ is the number of obstacles. For each command, we perform a constant amount of work, and the obstacle lookups take O(1) time due to the set.

- Space complexity:  
  The space complexity is $$O(n)$$ because we need to store all the obstacles in a set for O(1) lookup.

## Code
