## Problem Statement

[leetcode problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/online-stock-span/description/)

## Brute Force [TLE]

```python
class StockSpanner:

    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []

    def next(self, price: int) -> int:
        self.stack.append(price)
        st = []
        count = 0
        while self.stack:
            val = self.stack.pop()
            st.append(val)
            if val > price:
                break
            count += 1
        while st:
            self.stack.append(st.pop())
        return count


# Your StockSpanner object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = StockSpanner()
# param_1 = obj.next(price)
```

## Stack approach [Accepted]

```python
class StockSpanner:

    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []

    def next(self, price: int) -> int:
        spanning_day = 0
        while self.stack and self.stack[-1][0] <= price:
            _, day = self.stack.pop()
            spanning_day += day

        self.stack.append([price, spanning_day + 1])
        return spanning_day + 1


# Your StockSpanner object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = StockSpanner()
# param_1 = obj.next(price)
```

## Editorial

### Approach: Monotonic Stack

```python
class StockSpanner:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []

    def next(self, price: int) -> int:
        ans = 1
        while self.stack and self.stack[-1][0] <= price:
            ans += self.stack.pop()[1]

        self.stack.append([price, ans])
        return ans

# Your StockSpanner object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = StockSpanner()
# param_1 = obj.next(price)
```
