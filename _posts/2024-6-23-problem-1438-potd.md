## Problem Statement

![problem-1438](/assets/images/2024-06-23_08-59-23-problem-1438.png)

## Brute Force - Sliding window - TLE

```python
class Solution:
    def longestSubarray(self, nums: List[int], limit: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        res = 0
        start, end = 0, 0
        min_val, max_val = float('inf'), float('-inf')
        for end in range(n):
            min_val = min(nums[start:end+1])
            max_val = max(nums[start:end+1])
            diff = max_val - min_val
            if diff <= limit:
                res += 1
            else:
                start += 1
        return res
```

## Editorial

```python
class Solution:
    def longestSubarray(self, nums, limit):
        max_heap = []
        min_heap = []

        left = 0
        max_length = 0

        for right in range(len(nums)):
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-nums[right], right))
            heapq.heappush(min_heap, (nums[right], right))

            # Check if the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the current window exceeds the limit
            while -max_heap[0][0] - min_heap[0][0] > limit:
                # Move the left pointer to the right until the condition is satisfied.
                # This ensures we remove the element causing the violation
                left = min(max_heap[0][1], min_heap[0][1]) + 1

                # Remove elements from the heaps that are outside the current window
                while max_heap[0][1] < left:
                    heapq.heappop(max_heap)
                while min_heap[0][1] < left:
                    heapq.heappop(min_heap)

            # Update max_length with the length of the current valid window
            max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)

        return max_length
```
