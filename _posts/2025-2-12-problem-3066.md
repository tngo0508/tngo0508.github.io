## Problem Statement

![problem](/assets/images/2025-02-12_20-16-34-problem-3066.jpg)

## Intuition

The problem requires minimizing operations to ensure all elements in the list `nums` are at least `k`. The key observation is that we can iteratively combine the two smallest numbers to form a larger number, leveraging a min-heap for efficiency.

## Approach

1. **Use a Min-Heap:** Convert the list `nums` into a min-heap using `heapq.heapify(nums)`, allowing us to efficiently extract the smallest two elements.
2. **Iterate Until Condition is Met:** While there are at least two elements in `nums`:
   - Extract the two smallest elements `x` and `y`.
   - If both `x` and `y` are greater than or equal to `k`, return the operation count.
   - Otherwise, combine them using the formula `min(x, y) * 2 + max(x, y)`, and push the result back into the heap.
   - Increment the operation counter.
3. **Return the Operation Count:** If we exhaust the heap before all elements reach `k`, return the count of operations performed.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**

  - Heap operations (`heapify`, `heappop`, and `heappush`) take `O(log n)`, and we perform these up to `O(n)` times.
  - Overall complexity: **O(n log n)**.

- **Space Complexity:**
  - The heap is stored in place, so the space complexity is **O(1)** (excluding input storage).

## Code

```python
import heapq
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        heapq.heapify(nums)
        ops = 0
        while len(nums) >= 2:
            x = heapq.heappop(nums)
            y = heapq.heappop(nums)
            if x >= k and y >= k:
                return ops

            heapq.heappush(nums, min(x, y) * 2 + max(x, y))
            ops += 1
        return ops
```

## Editorial

### Approach: Priority Queue

```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        heapq.heapify(nums)

        num_operations = 0
        while nums[0] < k:
            x = heapq.heappop(nums)
            y = heapq.heappop(nums)
            heapq.heappush(nums, min(x, y) * 2 + max(x, y))

            num_operations += 1

        return num_operations
```

- time: O(nlogn)
- space: O(n)
