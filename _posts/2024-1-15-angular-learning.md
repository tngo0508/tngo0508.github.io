# Introduction to Typescript
- A strongly typed Programming Language
- Created and maintained by Microsoft
- Superset of JavaScript

# Why Typescript?
- Compiles to JavaScript
- Keeps your code evergreen
- Supported by all major libraries and frameworks
- Provide type safety while implementing in JavaScript

# Type Safety
- Keeps your application free from Type Errors
- Languages like C#, Java are example of Type safe language
- Keeps your JS Code free from undefined and null values
- In TypeScript Types are stripped when your code is converted to JS

# Installing and Creating First Typescript program
