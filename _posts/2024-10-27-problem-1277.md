## Problem Statement

![problem](/assets/images/2024-10-27_11-24-25-1277.png)

## Intuition

The problem requires us to find all possible square submatrices with all `1`s in a given matrix. The first step is to understand that for any submatrix to be a square, the difference between its row and column ranges must match. Additionally, since all elements within the square must be `1`, we need a way to validate each potential square region.

## Approach

1. **Identify matrix dimensions**: First, get the number of rows and columns in the matrix, and determine the smallest dimension (`n`), which is the maximum possible size of any square submatrix.

2. **Iterate through possible square sizes**: Start with the smallest square size (1x1) and work up to `n x n`. For each size, iterate over all possible top-left corners of submatrices of that size.

3. **Check submatrix validity**: For each potential square, check all cells to ensure they contain only `1`s by defining a helper method, `is_valid_submatrix`. This function returns `True` if all cells are `1`s and `False` otherwise.

4. **Count valid submatrices**: If the submatrix is valid, increment the result counter. After iterating through all possible submatrices, return the total count.

## Complexity

- **Time complexity**: The time complexity is approximately $$O(n^4)$$, where `n` represents the length of the matrix's longest dimension. This arises because:
  - We consider all possible submatrix sizes.
  - For each size, we iterate over the entire matrix to find valid squares, and each validation requires checking every cell within the square.
- **Space complexity**: $$O(1)$$, as we are only storing the integer `res` for the result and a few helper variables. No additional data structures are used that scale with the input size.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def countSquares(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        COLS = len(matrix[0])
        ROWS = len(matrix)
        n = min(COLS, ROWS)
        res = 0
        for size in range(1, n + 1):
            for row in range(ROWS):
                for col in range(COLS):
                    rs, re = row, row + size
                    cs, ce = col, col + size
                    if re > ROWS or ce > COLS:
                        break
                    res += self.is_valid_submatrix(rs, re, cs, ce, matrix)

        return res

    def is_valid_submatrix(self, rs, re, cs, ce, matrix):
        for row in range(rs, re):
            for col in range(cs, ce):
                if matrix[row][col] != 1:
                    return False
        return True
```

## Editorial

### Approach 1: Top-Down Dynamic Programming

```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, i, j, grid, dp):
        # If the cell lies outside the grid, return 0.
        if i >= len(grid) or j >= len(grid[0]):
            return 0
        if grid[i][j] == 0:
            return 0
        # If we have already visited this cell, return the memoized value.
        if dp[i][j] != -1:
            return dp[i][j]
        # Find the answer for the cell to the right of the current cell.
        right = self.solve(i, j + 1, grid, dp)
        # Find the answer for the cell to the diagonal of the current cell.
        diagonal = self.solve(i + 1, j + 1, grid, dp)
        # Find the answer for the cell below the current cell.
        below = self.solve(i + 1, j, grid, dp)
        dp[i][j] = 1 + min(right, min(diagonal, below))
        return dp[i][j]

    def countSquares(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        ans = 0
        dp = [[-1 for _ in range(len(matrix[0]))] for _ in range(len(matrix))]
        for i in range(len(matrix)):
            for j in range(len(matrix[0])):
                ans += self.solve(i, j, matrix, dp)
        return ans
