## Problem

[![problem-1484](/assets/images/2024-03-03_11-43-23-problem-1484.png)](/assets/images/2024-03-03_11-43-23-problem-1484.png)

## Query

```sql
SELECT
    sell_date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT product) as num_sold,
    GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product) as products
FROM
    Activities
GROUP BY
    sell_date
ORDER BY sell_date
```

## Editorial Solution

Approach: Grouping and aggregation of strings

```sql
SELECT
    sell_date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT(product)) AS num_sold,
    GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product ORDER BY product SEPARATOR ',') AS products
FROM
    Activities
GROUP BY
    sell_date
ORDER BY
    sell_date ASC
```
