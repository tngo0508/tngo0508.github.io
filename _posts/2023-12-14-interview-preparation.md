# Explaining Gaps Between Employments
## Short Version
> During employment gaps, I intentionally invested time in personal and professional development. After completing my Master's in 2021, I pursued certifications like AWS Cloud Practitioner and SAFe 5. Additionally, I worked on personal projects like CodeTrack and my blog, ensuring I stay current with industry trends and bring valuable insights to any role.

## Long Version
During the periods where you see gaps in my employment history, I deliberately took time to invest in my personal and professional development. After completing my Master's degree in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton in June 2021, I wanted to ensure that I was not only well-versed academically but also equipped with the latest industry knowledge.

In that interim, I took the opportunity to pursue certifications, such as becoming a Certified AWS Cloud Practitioner and SAFe 5 Practitioner. This allowed me to deepen my understanding of cloud technologies and agile methodologies, aligning my skills with the evolving demands of the industry.

Additionally, I embarked on personal projects, such as developing CodeTrack, an ASP.NET Core MVC Web application, and managing my personal blog at thomasngoswe.com. These experiences not only honed my technical skills but also gave me a chance to explore my creative side.

Overall, these intentional breaks were instrumental in my continuous learning journey, ensuring that I stay at the forefront of technological advancements and bring valuable insights to any role.

# Explaining Short-Term Employments
## Short version
> Short-term employments provided opportunities to diversify experiences. At UPS, I collaborated on the MDVA Dashboard project, gaining valuable insights into data visualization. Similarly, at ETAP, I contributed to projects like eWeb and HMIViewer, enriching my skill set. Despite being brief, these experiences added depth to my capabilities.

## Long version
In terms of my shorter-term employments, I see them as valuable opportunities to diversify my experiences and contribute to different projects. For instance, my role at United Parcel Service (UPS) as a Software Developer Intern was a short-term commitment where I collaborated on the MDVA Dashboard project within an agile software development team.

During this time, I actively contributed to the development of dispatch time usage and map reports, gaining valuable experience in jQuery and JavaScript libraries. While the tenure was brief, it provided me with insights into data visualization and agile methodologies.

Similarly, my role at ETAP - Operation Technology, Inc. as a Software Engineer for the first half of 2022 allowed me to work on projects like eWeb, HMIViewer, and HMIDesigner. I was able to implement new features based on incident requests, conduct debugging, and enhance internal tools.

In both cases, even though the employments were short-term, the experiences were rich, and I believe they added depth to my skill set. I'm now eager to bring this diverse skill set and knowledge to a long-term position where I can make a meaningful impact.

# Explaining Reasons for Leaving a Job
> I left my last position to seek a new challenge and better career growth opportunities. As my values evolved, I found misalignment with the company's mission. I'm excited about contributing my skills to a role aligned with my aspirations and values.
