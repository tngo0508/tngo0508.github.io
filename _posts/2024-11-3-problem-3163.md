## Problem Statement

![problem](/assets/images/2024-11-03_18-01-06-3163.png)

## Intuition

The initial idea was to compress a string by grouping consecutive identical characters and keeping track of their frequency. By replacing consecutive characters with a count followed by the character itself, we reduce the string length, especially when there are long sequences of the same character. This approach seemed efficient for generating a compressed string without performing multiple scans or transformations.

## Approach

1. **Initialize a Queue**: Use a queue to store pairs of characters and their consecutive counts as we iterate through the string.
2. **Iterate Through Each Character**:
   - For each character `c` in the input string `word`, check the last character stored in the queue.
   - If the queue is empty, add the character `c` with a count of 1.
   - If `c` matches the last character in the queue and its frequency is less than 9 (to avoid exceeding a single-digit limit), increment the frequency of the last character in the queue.
   - Otherwise, push `c` to the queue with a frequency of 1.
3. **Build the Result**:
   - Once all characters are processed, use a loop to dequeue elements from `queue`.
   - Append each character's frequency and value to a result list, `res`.
4. **Return the Compressed String**:
   - Join the elements in `res` to form the final compressed string.

## Complexity

- **Time complexity**: $$O(n)$$ where \( n \) is the length of `word`, as we perform a single pass through the input string.
- **Space complexity**: $$O(n)$$, due to the queue and result list used to store intermediate values.

## Code

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def compressedString(self, word: str) -> str:
        queue = deque()
        res = []
        for c in word:
            if not queue:
                queue.append([c, 1])
            else:
                if c == queue[-1][0] and queue[-1][1] < 9:
                    queue[-1][1] += 1
                else:
                    queue.append([c, 1])

        while queue:
            c, f = queue.popleft()
            res.append(str(f) + c)

        return ''.join(res)
```

## Editorial

### Approach: String Manipulation

```python
class Solution:
    def compressedString(self, word: str) -> str:
        comp = []

        # pos tracks our position in the input string
        pos = 0

        # Process until we reach end of string
        while pos < len(word):
            consecutive_count = 0

            current_char = word[pos]

            # Count consecutive occurrences (maximum 9)
            while (
                pos < len(word)
                and consecutive_count < 9
                and word[pos] == current_char
            ):
                consecutive_count += 1
                pos += 1

            # Append count followed by character to the list
            comp.append(str(consecutive_count))
            comp.append(current_char)

        # Join the list into a single string for the final result
        return "".join(comp)
```

- space: O(1)
