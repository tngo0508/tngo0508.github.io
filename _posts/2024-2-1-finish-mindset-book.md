# Summary
Today, I have finished reading the Mindset book by Carol S. Dweck. To summarize the content and test my understanding, I attempted to write the summary here to challenge myself and attempted internalize the materials that I have consumed from the book. Basically, the book focused two type of mindset: fixed-mindset and growth-mindset. The fixed-mindset says to us that we can only have certain natural talents and have limitation on our capabilities. On the other hand, the growth-mindset opposed the different ideas where our abilities and talent can be honed and trained to achieve the next level as long as we put the effort and persistent to it. The book provides examples in leadership, relationship, parenting, business, and education with both mindsets. As I read through the content, people with fixed-mindset have tendency to give up easily on the road to success. They are sensitive to criticism, they are afraid of risking and losing their confidence after setback. Otherwise, the people with growth-mindset seem to have a much stronger resistance to change and negative feedback. They embrace the challenges and love to learn new things. The strong will of a growth-mindset helps to persist in face of setbacks. To be clear in my writing, you can take a look at the following picture from Nigel Holmes about the two mindsets.

Everyone has both fixed-mindset and growth-mindset in different areas or beliefs. However, in order to change mindsets, the author provides a procedures consists of four steps that we can take to transform our mindsets. Keep in mind that the journey is long and eternal. We should not expect it to be short and easy road. Even after we obtain the growth-mindset, if we don't intend to keep it, we are going to lose it either way. So, here is the steps to achieve the growth-mindset.

- Step 1: embrace your fixed-mindset.
- Step 2: become aware of our fixed-mindset triggers.
- Step 3: give our fixed-mindset a name.
- Step 4: educate it and take it on the journey with us.
