## Problem

[![problem-1204](/assets/images/2024-02-28_19-59-36-problem-1204.png)](/assets/images/2024-02-28_19-59-36-problem-1204.png)

## Query

```sql
SELECT
    t.person_name
FROM
    (
        SELECT
            *,
            (@cumtotal := @cumtotal + q.weight) as total_weight
        FROM
            Queue as q,
            (SELECT @cumtotal:= 0 as cumtotal) temp
        ORDER BY
            turn
    ) t
WHERE
    t.total_weight <= 1000
ORDER BY
    t.total_weight DESC
LIMIT 1
```

## Use Window Function Approach

```sql
SELECT
    q.person_name
FROM
    (
        SELECT
            *,
            SUM(weight) OVER (ORDER BY turn ASC) AS cumulative_sum
        FROM
            Queue
    ) q
WHERE
    q.cumulative_sum <= 1000
ORDER BY
    q.cumulative_sum DESC
LIMIT 1
```
