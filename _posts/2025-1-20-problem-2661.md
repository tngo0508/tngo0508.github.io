## Problem Statement

![problem](/assets/images/2025-01-20_08-25-49-problem-2661.jpg)

## Intuition

The problem requires finding the first complete row or column after processing elements in the array `arr`. My initial thought was to keep track of the frequency of elements in rows and columns as they appear in `arr` and determine the point at which any row or column becomes "complete" (all elements in that row/column are present in `arr`).

## Approach

1. **Initialization**:

   - Identify the number of rows (`ROWS`) and columns (`COLS`) in the matrix `mat`.
   - Create two frequency arrays, `row_freq` and `col_freq`, to track how many elements have been processed for each row and column.
   - Use a dictionary `pos` to map each value in `mat` to its coordinates `(row, col)`.

2. **Mapping Values**:

   - Traverse the matrix `mat` and populate the `pos` dictionary with the positions of each value.

3. **Processing Array**:
   - Iterate through the array `arr`.
   - For each value in `arr`, retrieve its position `(row, col)` using the `pos` dictionary.
   - Increment the corresponding row and column frequencies in `row_freq` and `col_freq`.
   - Check if the updated frequency for the row or column equals the number of elements in that row/column:
     - If so, return the current index `i` as it represents the first complete row or column.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:

  - Preprocessing the matrix to populate `pos` takes $$O(ROWS \times COLS)$$.
  - Iterating through the array `arr` takes $$O(n)$$, where `n` is the length of `arr`.
  - Overall, the complexity is $$O(ROWS \times COLS + n)$$.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - Storing the `pos` dictionary requires $$O(ROWS \times COLS)$$.
  - Frequency arrays `row_freq` and `col_freq` require $$O(ROWS + COLS)$$.
  - Overall, the complexity is $$O(ROWS \times COLS)$$.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def firstCompleteIndex(self, arr: List[int], mat: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        ROWS = len(mat)
        COLS = len(mat[0])
        row_freq = [0] * ROWS
        col_freq = [0] * COLS
        pos = defaultdict(list)

        for row in range(ROWS):
            for col in range(COLS):
                val = mat[row][col]
                pos[val] = [row, col]

        for i, x in enumerate(arr):
            row, col = pos[x]
            row_freq[row] += 1
            col_freq[col] += 1
            if row_freq[row] == COLS or col_freq[col] == ROWS:
                return i
```

## Editorial

### Approach 2: Brute Force Optimized with Counting

```python
class Solution:
    def firstCompleteIndex(self, arr: List[int], mat: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        num_rows, num_cols = len(mat), len(mat[0])
        row_count, col_count = [0] * num_rows, [0] * num_cols
        num_to_pos = {}

        # Create a map to store the position of each number in the matrix
        for row in range(num_rows):
            for col in range(num_cols):
                num_to_pos[mat[row][col]] = [row, col]

        for i in range(len(arr)):
            num = arr[i]
            row, col = num_to_pos[num]

            # Increment the count for the corresponding row and column
            row_count[row] += 1
            col_count[col] += 1

            # Check if the row or column is completely painted
            if row_count[row] == num_cols or col_count[col] == num_rows:
                return i

        # This line will never be reached as per the problem statement
        return -1
```

### Approach 3: Reverse Mapping

```python
class Solution:
    def firstCompleteIndex(self, arr, mat):
        # Map to store the index of each number in the arr
        num_to_index = {}
        for i in range(len(arr)):
            num_to_index[arr[i]] = i

        result = float("inf")
        num_rows, num_cols = len(mat), len(mat[0])

        # Check for the earliest row to be completely painted
        for row in range(num_rows):
            # Tracks the greatest index in this row
            last_element_index = float("-inf")
            for col in range(num_cols):
                index_val = num_to_index[mat[row][col]]
                last_element_index = max(last_element_index, index_val)

            # Update result with the minimum index where this row is fully painted
            result = min(result, last_element_index)

        # Check for the earliest column to be completely painted
        for col in range(num_cols):
            last_element_index = float("-inf")
            for row in range(num_rows):
                index_val = num_to_index[mat[row][col]]
                last_element_index = max(last_element_index, index_val)

            # Update result with the minimum index where this column is fully painted
            result = min(result, last_element_index)

        return result
```
