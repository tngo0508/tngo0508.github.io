## Problem Statement

![2053](/assets/images/2024-08-04_18-59-55-problem-2053.png)

## Intuition

My first thought on solving this problem is to count the frequency of each string in the given array. By doing this, I can identify which strings are distinct (i.e., appear exactly once). Once I have this information, I can simply traverse the array again to find the k-th distinct string.

## Approach

1. I will use a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of each string in the array.
2. Then, I will iterate through the array to build this frequency dictionary.
3. Next, I will traverse the array a second time and collect the distinct strings (those with a frequency of 1) in a temporary list.
4. As I collect these distinct strings, I will check if the length of the list equals `k`. If it does, I return the k-th distinct string.
5. If I reach the end of the array and have not found k distinct strings, I will return an empty string.

## Complexity

- Time complexity:  
  The time complexity is $$O(n)$$ because I am making two passes over the array. The first pass is to build the frequency dictionary, and the second pass is to collect distinct strings and check their order.

- Space complexity:  
  The space complexity is $$O(n)$$ because I am using a dictionary to store the frequency of each string and a list to store the distinct strings.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def kthDistinct(self, arr: List[str], k: int) -> str:
        freq = defaultdict(int)
        temp = []

        # First pass: build the frequency dictionary
        for c in arr:
            freq[c] += 1

        # Second pass: collect distinct strings and find the k-th one
        for c in arr:
            if freq[c] == 1:
                temp.append(c)
            if len(temp) == k:
                return c

        # If there are less than k distinct strings, return an empty string
        return ""
```
