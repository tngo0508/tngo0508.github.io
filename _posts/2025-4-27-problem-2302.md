## Problem Statement

[leetcode problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-subarrays-with-score-less-than-k/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-04-28)

## Intuition

At first glance, we are asked to count the number of subarrays where the product of the length of the subarray and the sum of its elements is **less than** `k`.  
A brute-force solution would be to try all subarrays and check the condition, but that would be too slow.  
Since the condition involves **sum of elements**, a sliding window approach came to mind: we can grow the window and shrink it dynamically depending on whether the condition is satisfied.

## Approach

We use two pointers (`start` and `end`) to represent the current window.

- We expand the window by moving `end` and adding `nums[end]` to `curr_total` (the sum of elements inside the window).
- If at any point the condition `(window size) * (curr_total) >= k` is violated, we shrink the window by moving `start` forward and subtracting `nums[start]` from `curr_total`.
- After adjusting the window to be valid, the number of valid subarrays ending at index `end` is `(end - start + 1)`.
- We accumulate this count into `res` for every `end`.

This way, we efficiently count all valid subarrays without checking each one individually.

## Complexity

- **Time complexity:**  
  $$O(n)$$  
  Each element is added and removed from the sliding window at most once, leading to linear time complexity.

- **Space complexity:**  
  $$O(1)$$  
  Only a few variables are used regardless of input size.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def countSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        start = 0
        N = len(nums)
        curr_total = 0
        res = 0
        for end in range(N):
            curr_total += nums[end]
            while start <= end and (end - start + 1) * curr_total >= k:
                curr_total -= nums[start]
                start += 1
            res += (end - start + 1)
        return res

```
