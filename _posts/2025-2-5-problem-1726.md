## Problem Statement

![problem](/assets/images/2025-02-05_21-38-17-problem-1726.jpg)

## Brute Force [TLE]

```python
class Solution:
    def tupleSameProduct(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        self.res = 0
        N = len(nums)
        def dfs(idx, curr):
            if len(curr) == 4:
                if (curr[0] * curr[1]) == (curr[2] * curr[3]):
                    self.res += 1
                return
            if idx == N:
                return
            for i in range(N):
                nums[0], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[0]
                if nums[0] not in curr:
                    dfs(idx + 1, curr + [nums[0]])
                nums[0], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[0]


        dfs(0, [])
        return self.res
```

# Understanding the Formula: \( \frac{x(x - 1)}{2} \)

The formula:

\[
\frac{x(x - 1)}{2}
\]

is commonly used to calculate the number of **unique pairs** that can be formed from \(x\) items. This appears frequently in problems related to combinations, such as the handshake problem, network connections, or any scenario where you're counting distinct pairs.

## How to Derive the Formula

### 1. **Identify the Problem**

Imagine you have \(x\) people in a room, and you want to determine how many **unique handshakes** can occur if each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once.

### 2. **Brute Force Counting (Example with 5 People)**

Let’s manually count for 5 people (A, B, C, D, E):

- **A** shakes hands with B, C, D, E → **4 handshakes**
- **B** has already shaken hands with A, so new handshakes with C, D, E → **3 handshakes**
- **C** has already shaken hands with A and B, so new handshakes with D, E → **2 handshakes**
- **D** has already shaken hands with A, B, C, so new handshake with E → **1 handshake**
- **E** has already shaken hands with everyone → **0 new handshakes**

**Total handshakes:**

\[
4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10
\]

### 3. **Recognize the Pattern**

Notice we are summing the first \(4\) positive integers:

\[
(5 - 1) + (5 - 2) + (5 - 3) + (5 - 4) = 4 + 3 + 2 + 1
\]

For \(x\) people, the sum is:

\[
(x - 1) + (x - 2) + \dots + 1
\]

This is the **sum of the first \(x - 1\) positive integers**.

### 4. **Apply the Formula for the Sum of Integers**

The formula for the sum of the first \(n\) positive integers is:

\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

In our case, \(n = x - 1\). Therefore:

\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{(x - 1) \cdot x}{2}
\]

or equivalently:

\[
\frac{x(x - 1)}{2}
\]

### 5. **Why Divide by 2?**

When you form pairs, each connection is counted **twice** if you just multiply \(x\) by \(x - 1\):

- Person A shaking hands with B is the same as B shaking hands with A.

To **avoid double-counting**, we divide by 2.

## Generalization

- **Each item** pairs with \((x - 1)\) others.
- **Avoid double-counting** by dividing by 2.

### Final Formula:

\[
\frac{x(x - 1)}{2}
\]

This formula is fundamental in combinatorics and helps solve problems involving unique pairings quickly and efficiently.

### Approach 2: Count Product Frequency

```python
class Solution:
    def tupleSameProduct(self, nums):
        nums_length = len(nums)

        pair_products = []

        total_number_of_tuples = 0

        # Iterate over nums to calculate all pairwise products
        for first_index in range(nums_length):
            for second_index in range(first_index + 1, nums_length):
                pair_products.append(nums[first_index] * nums[second_index])

        pair_products.sort()

        last_product_seen = -1
        same_product_count = 0

        # Iterate over pair_products to count how many times each product occurs
        for product_index in range(len(pair_products)):
            if pair_products[product_index] == last_product_seen:
                # Increment the count of same products
                same_product_count += 1
            else:
                # Calculate how many pairs had the previous product value
                pairs_of_equal_product = (
                    (same_product_count - 1) * same_product_count // 2
                )

                total_number_of_tuples += 8 * pairs_of_equal_product

                # Update last_product_seen and reset same_product_count
                last_product_seen = pair_products[product_index]
                same_product_count = 1

        # Handle the last group of products (since the loop ends without adding
        # it)
        pairs_of_equal_product = (
            (same_product_count - 1) * same_product_count // 2
        )
        total_number_of_tuples += 8 * pairs_of_equal_product

        return total_number_of_tuples
```

### Approach 3: Product Frequency Hash Map

```python
class Solution(object):
    def tupleSameProduct(self, nums):
        nums_length = len(nums)

        # Initialize a dictionary to store the frequency of each product of pairs
        pair_products_frequency = {}

        total_number_of_tuples = 0

        # Iterate through each pair of numbers in `nums`
        for first_index in range(nums_length):
            for second_index in range(first_index + 1, nums_length):
                # Increment the frequency of the product of the current pair
                product_value = nums[first_index] * nums[second_index]
                if product_value in pair_products_frequency:
                    pair_products_frequency[product_value] += 1
                else:
                    pair_products_frequency[product_value] = 1

        # Iterate through each product value and its frequency in the dictionary
        for product_frequency in pair_products_frequency.values():
            # Calculate the number of ways to choose two pairs with the same product
            pairs_of_equal_product = (
                (product_frequency - 1) * product_frequency // 2
            )

            # Add the number of tuples for this product to the total (each pair
            # can form 8 tuples)
            total_number_of_tuples += 8 * pairs_of_equal_product

        return total_number_of_tuples
```
