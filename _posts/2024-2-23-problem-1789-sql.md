## Problem

[![problem-1789](/assets/images/2024-02-23_14-12-44-problem-1789.png)](/assets/images/2024-02-23_14-12-44-problem-1789.png)

## Query

```sql
(
    SELECT employee_id, department_id
    FROM Employee
    WHERE primary_flag = 'Y'
)
UNION
(
    SELECT employee_id, department_id
    FROM Employee
    GROUP BY employee_id
    HAVING COUNT(department_id) = 1
)
```

## Editorial Solution

### Approach 1: UNION

```sql
-- Retrieving employees with primary_flag set to 'Y'
SELECT 
  employee_id, 
  department_id 
FROM 
  Employee 
WHERE 
  primary_flag = 'Y' 
UNION 
-- Retrieving employees that appear exactly once in the Employee table
SELECT 
  employee_id, 
  department_id 
FROM 
  Employee 
GROUP BY 
  employee_id 
HAVING 
  COUNT(employee_id) = 1;
```

### Approach 2: Window Function (COUNT)

Step 1 - Inner Query with Window Function:

```sql
SELECT 
  *, 
  COUNT(employee_id) OVER(PARTITION BY employee_id) AS EmployeeCount 
FROM 
  Employee
```

Result:

| employee_id | department_id | primary_flag | EmployeeCount |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| 1           | 1             | N            | 1             |
| 2           | 1             | Y            | 2             |
| 2           | 2             | N            | 2             |
| 3           | 3             | N            | 1             |
| 4           | 2             | N            | 3             |
| 4           | 3             | Y            | 3             |
| 4           | 4             | N            | 3             |

Note:

- `COUNT(employee_id) OVER(PARTITION BY employee_id)` is a window function
  - `PARTITION BY employee_id`: This breaks down the data into 'windows' or 'partitions' of rows that have the same `employee_id`. Each window is essentially a subset of the data for a specific employee.
  - `COUNT(employee_id) OVER(...)`: This counts the number of rows (i.e., the number of departments) for each employee within their respective partition/window. The result is a new column, `EmployeeCount`, which tells us how many departments each employee is associated with. This count is repeated for every row of the same employee.

Step 2 - Alias & Outer Query:

```sql
SELECT 
  employee_id, 
  department_id 
FROM 
  EmployeePartition 
```

Step 3 - Filtering with WHERE Clause:

```sql
WHERE 
  EmployeeCount = 1 
  OR primary_flag = 'Y'
```

Final implementation:

```sql
SELECT 
  employee_id, 
  department_id 
FROM 
  (
    SELECT 
      *, 
      COUNT(employee_id) OVER(PARTITION BY employee_id) AS EmployeeCount
    FROM 
      Employee
  ) EmployeePartition 
WHERE 
  EmployeeCount = 1 
  OR primary_flag = 'Y';
```
