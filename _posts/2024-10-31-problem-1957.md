## Problem Statement

![problem](/assets/images/2024-10-31_20-48-48-problem1957.png)

## Intuition

The goal of this algorithm is to remove consecutive characters from a string if they appear three or more times in a row. The idea is to iterate through each character and keep track of the previous character and its count. This helps us decide when to skip adding a character to the result to avoid having three consecutive identical characters.

## Approach

1. Initialize an empty list `stack` to store the resulting characters.
2. Use a variable `prev` to keep track of the last character added to the result and a `count` variable to track consecutive occurrences of this character.
3. Iterate through each character `c` in the string:
   - If `c` is the same as `prev`, increase the count.
   - If `c` is different, reset the count to 1.
   - If `count` is less than 3, add `c` to the `stack`. Otherwise, skip it.
4. Update `prev` to `c` after each iteration to reflect the most recent character added to `stack`.
5. Finally, join the characters in `stack` to form the final string without any three consecutive identical characters.

## Complexity

- **Time complexity**: \(O(n)\)  
  We iterate through each character in the input string `s` once, where `n` is the length of the string.

- **Space complexity**: \(O(n)\)  
  The stack list may store up to all characters in `s` if none are skipped, resulting in an \(O(n)\) space requirement.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def makeFancyString(self, s: str) -> str:
        stack = []
        prev = ''
        count = 0
        for c in s:
            if stack:
                if prev == c:
                    count += 1
                else:
                    count = 1
                if count >= 3:
                    continue
            else:
                count = 1
            prev = c
            stack.append(c)
        return ''.join(stack)
```

## Approach 1: Insert characters in a new string

```python
class Solution:
    def makeFancyString(self, s: str) -> str:

        prev = s[0]
        frequency = 1
        ans = s[0]

        for i in range(1, len(s)):
            if s[i] == prev:
                frequency += 1
            else:
                prev = s[i]
                frequency = 1

            if frequency < 3:
                ans += s[i]

        return ans
```

## Approach 2: In-Place Two-Pointer Approach

```python
class Solution:
    def makeFancyString(self, s: str) -> str:
        # If size of string is less than 3, return it.
        if len(s) < 3:
            return s

        # Convert the string to a list for mutability.
        s_list = list(s)
        j = 2

        # Iterate through the string from index 2.
        for i in range(2, len(s)):
            # If the current character is not equal to the previously inserted
            # two characters, then we can add it to the result.
            if s_list[i] != s_list[j - 1] or s_list[i] != s_list[j - 2]:
                s_list[j] = s_list[i]
                j += 1

        # Resize the list to the number of valid characters and join it back into a string.
        return "".join(s_list[:j])
```
