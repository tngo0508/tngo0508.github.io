## Problem Statement

![problem-1119](/assets/images/2024-03-22_14-51-34-problem-1119.png)

## Intuition

My initial thought is to iterate through the given string and remove any vowels encountered.

## Approach

To implement this, I'll loop through each character in the string. If the character is not a vowel (i.e., not 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u'), I'll add it to a result list. Finally, I'll join the characters in the result list to form the final string without vowels.

## Complexity

- Time complexity:
  O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we iterate through the string once.

- Space complexity:
  O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is due to the result list that holds the characters without vowels.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def removeVowels(self, s: str) -> str:
        res = []
        for c in s:
            if c not in {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}:
                res.append(c)
        return ''.join(res)
```
