## Problem Statement

[leetcode problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-number-of-fair-pairs/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-04-19)

## Intuition

To solve this problem efficiently, we want to avoid checking all pairs directly, which would result in O(n²) time. Instead, we consider sorting the array and using a two-pointer technique to count the number of valid pairs within the given sum range. This approach is both elegant and efficient.

## Approach

1. Sort the input array `nums` to enable efficient range-based sum counting using the two-pointer technique.
2. Define a helper function `helper(target)` that counts the number of index pairs `(i, j)` where `nums[i] + nums[j] < target`.
   - Use two pointers `l` and `r` to scan the array from both ends.
   - If the sum of `nums[l] + nums[r]` is less than `target`, all elements between `l` and `r` can form a valid pair with `nums[l]`. Increment the count accordingly and move `l` forward.
   - Otherwise, move `r` backward to find a smaller pair.
3. Use the helper function to calculate:
   - `helper(upper + 1)` → counts pairs with sum ≤ `upper`
   - `helper(lower)` → counts pairs with sum < `lower`
   - The result is the difference: `helper(upper + 1) - helper(lower)`, which gives the number of pairs with sum in `[lower, upper]`.

## Complexity

- Time complexity:  
  $$O(n \log n)$$  
  Sorting takes \( O(n \log n) \) and each helper call takes \( O(n) \). Since we call the helper twice, total time is still \( O(n \log n) \).

- Space complexity:  
  $$O(1)$$  
  Aside from sorting (which may require some space depending on the implementation), no extra space is used.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def countFairPairs(self, nums: List[int], lower: int, upper: int) -> int:
        N = len(nums)
        nums.sort()

        def helper(target):
            l, r = 0, N - 1
            ans = 0
            while l < r:
                val = nums[l] + nums[r]
                if val < target:
                    ans += r - l
                    l += 1
                else:
                    r -= 1
            return ans

        return helper(upper + 1) - helper(lower)

```
