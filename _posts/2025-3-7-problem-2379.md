## Problem Statement

![problem](/assets/images/2025-03-07_17-10-15-problem-2379.jpg)

## Intuition

The problem requires us to find the minimum number of recolors needed to get a contiguous substring of length `k` that consists only of black (`'B'`) blocks. Our first thought is to consider all possible substrings of length `k` and determine how many white (`'W'`) blocks need to be changed in each case.

## Approach

We iterate through all possible substrings of length `k` in the given `blocks` string. For each substring, we count the number of `'W'` characters and track the minimum count encountered.

Steps:

1. Iterate over all possible `k`-length substrings in `blocks`.
2. Count the number of `'W'` blocks in each substring using `Counter`.
3. Keep track of the minimum number of white blocks found across all substrings.
4. Return this minimum value as the answer.

## Complexity

- **Time complexity:**

  - We iterate through `N - k + 1` substrings, and for each substring, we count the occurrences of `'W'`. Using `Counter(blocks[i:i+k])` takes `O(k)`, making the overall complexity **O(Nk)**.
  - This can be improved to **O(N)** using a sliding window approach.

- **Space complexity:**
  - We only use a few variables for tracking results and a `Counter` object with at most `O(k)` space, leading to an overall **O(1)** auxiliary space complexity.

## Code

```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def minimumRecolors(self, blocks: str, k: int) -> int:
        N = len(blocks)
        res = float('inf')
        for i in range(N - k + 1):
            counter = Counter(blocks[i:i+k])
            res = min(res, counter['W'])
        return res
```

## Editorial

### Approach 1: Queue

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumRecolors(self, blocks: str, k: int) -> int:
        block_queue = deque()
        num_whites = 0

        # Initiate queue with first k values
        for i in range(k):
            current_char = blocks[i]
            if current_char == "W":
                num_whites += 1
            block_queue.append(current_char)

        # Set initial minimum
        num_recolors = num_whites

        for i in range(k, len(blocks)):

            # Remove front element from queue and update current number of white blocks
            if block_queue.popleft() == "W":
                num_whites -= 1

            # Add current element to queue and update current number of white blocks
            current_char = blocks[i]
            if current_char == "W":
                num_whites += 1
            block_queue.append(current_char)

            # Update minimum
            num_recolors = min(num_recolors, num_whites)

        return num_recolors
```

### Approach 2: Sliding Window

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumRecolors(self, blocks: str, k: int) -> int:
        left = 0
        num_whites = 0
        num_recolors = float("inf")

        # Move right pointer
        for right in range(len(blocks)):

            # Increment num_whites if block at right pointer is white
            if blocks[right] == "W":
                num_whites += 1

            # k consecutive elements are found
            if right - left + 1 == k:

                # Update minimum
                num_recolors = min(num_recolors, num_whites)

                # Decrement num_whites if block at left pointer is white
                if blocks[left] == "W":
                    num_whites -= 1

                # Move left pointer
                left += 1

        return num_recolors
```
