## Problem Statement

![problem](/assets/images/2024-09-08_17-06-36-problem-408.png)

## Intuition

The problem is asking us to verify if an abbreviation matches the full word. The abbreviation may contain numbers, which represent a number of characters to skip in the original word. Our first intuition is to iterate through the abbreviation, interpreting digits as skips and ensuring that non-digit characters match the corresponding characters in the word.

## Approach

We maintain two pointers, one for traversing the abbreviation and another for tracking our position in the word. As we go through the abbreviation:

- If we encounter a number, we convert it into an integer and skip that many characters in the word.
- If we encounter a letter, we check if it matches the letter in the corresponding position of the word.
- If at any point the number of characters to skip goes beyond the word length or if a character mismatch occurs, we return `False`.
- Finally, we ensure both the abbreviation and word are fully traversed simultaneously for a valid match.

## Complexity

- **Time complexity:**  
  The time complexity of this approach is $$O(n + m)$$, where $$n$$ is the length of the word and $$m$$ is the length of the abbreviation. In the worst case, we scan through both the word and the abbreviation.

- **Space complexity:**  
  The space complexity is $$O(1)$$ because we are only using a few extra variables, and no additional space that scales with input size.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def validWordAbbreviation(self, word: str, abbr: str) -> bool:
        if len(word) < len(abbr):
            return False
        word_ptr = 0
        len_abbr = len(abbr)
        i = 0
        while i < len(abbr):
            if abbr[i].isdigit():
                number_str = []
                while i < len(abbr) and abbr[i].isdigit():
                    number_str.append(abbr[i])
                    if number_str[0] == '0':
                        return False
                    i += 1
                curr_len = int(''.join(number_str))
                word_ptr += curr_len
            else:
                if word[word_ptr] != abbr[i]:
                    return False
                word_ptr += 1
                i += 1
            if word_ptr >= len(word):
                break
        return word_ptr == len(word) and i == len(abbr)
```
