## Problem Statement

![problem-2958](/assets/images/2024-03-27_18-59-50-problem-2958.png)

## Intuition

Initially, I'm considering using a sliding window approach to solve this problem. By maintaining a window and adjusting it based on certain conditions, I should be able to efficiently find the maximum subarray length where the frequency of each element is at most k.

## Approach

I'll initialize pointers `start` and `end` to mark the beginning and end of the current window, respectively. I'll also use a dictionary (`freq`) to keep track of the frequency of each element within the current window. The idea is to move the `end` pointer forward, updating the frequency dictionary accordingly. If the frequency of any element exceeds k, I'll adjust the `start` pointer to shrink the window until the condition is met again. At each step, I'll update the result with the maximum subarray length found so far.

## Complexity

- Time complexity:
  O(n), where n is the length of the input list `nums`. The algorithm scans through the list once.

- Space complexity:
  O(n), where n is the length of the input list `nums`. The space complexity is due to the dictionary `freq`, which could potentially store all elements of the list.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def maxSubarrayLength(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        start = end = 0
        freq = defaultdict(int)
        res = 0
        for end, num in enumerate(nums):
            freq[num] += 1
            while start <= end and freq[num] > k:
                freq[nums[start]] -= 1
                start += 1
            res = max(res, end - start + 1)

        return res
```
