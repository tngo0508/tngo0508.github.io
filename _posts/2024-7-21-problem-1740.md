## Problem Statement

![1740](/assets/images/2024-07-21_09-50-04-problem-1740.png)

## Intuition

When I first thought about solving the problem of finding the distance between two nodes in a binary tree, I realized that the key challenge was to locate their Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA). Once I find the LCA, the distance between the two nodes can be easily computed by summing up their respective distances from this ancestor.

## Approach

1. **Finding the LCA**:

   - I implemented a recursive function `find_lca` to traverse the binary tree and identify the LCA of the two nodes, `p` and `q`.
   - This function returns `True` if either of the nodes is found in the subtree rooted at the current node, and it sets `self.lca` when both nodes are found in different subtrees of the current node.

2. **Calculating Distances**:
   - Once the LCA is found, I used another recursive function `dfs` to compute the distance from the LCA to each of the two nodes, `p` and `q`.
   - The distance between `p` and `q` is then the sum of the distances from the LCA to each of these nodes.

## Complexity

- **Time complexity**:

  - Finding the LCA takes \(O(n)\) time in the worst case, where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree, since we potentially visit every node once.
  - Calculating the distances from the LCA to each node also takes \(O(n)\) in the worst case, though it's generally faster since we start from the LCA.
  - Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n)\).

- **Space complexity**:
  - The space complexity is \(O(h)\), where \(h\) is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursive call stack used in both `find_lca` and `dfs` functions.

## Code

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def findDistance(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], p: int, q: int) -> int:
        self.lca = None
        def find_lca(node):
            if not node:
                return False
            L = find_lca(node.left)
            R = find_lca(node.right)
            mid = node.val == q or node.val == p
            if L + R + mid >= 2:
                self.lca = node
                return True
            return L or R or mid

        find_lca(root)

        def dfs(node, target, dist):
            if not node:
                return 0
            if node.val == target:
                return dist
            return dfs(node.left, target, dist + 1) or \
                dfs(node.right, target, dist + 1)

        dist_q = dfs(self.lca, q, 0)
        dist_p = dfs(self.lca, p, 0)
        return dist_q + dist_p
```

## Editorial

### Approach 1: Brute Force (Lowest Common Ancestor and Depth-First Search)

```python
class Solution:
    def findDistance(self, root, p, q):
        # Find the lowest common ancestor of p and q.
        lca = self.__find_LCA(root, p, q)
        return self.__depth(lca, p) + self.__depth(lca, q)

    # Function to find the LCA of the given nodes.
    def __find_LCA(self, root, p, q):
        if root is None or root.val == p or root.val == q:
            return root
        left = self.__find_LCA(root.left, p, q)
        right = self.__find_LCA(root.right, p, q)
        if left is not None and right is not None:
            return root
        return left if left is not None else right

    # Function to find the depth of the node with respect to LCA.
    def __depth(self, root, target, current_depth=0):
        # Node not found
        if root is None:
            return -1
        if root.val == target:
            return current_depth

        # Check left subtree
        left_depth = self.__depth(root.left, target, current_depth + 1)
        if left_depth != -1:
            return left_depth

        # If not in left subtree, it is guaranteed to be in right subtree
        return self.__depth(root.right, target, current_depth + 1)
```

### Approach 2: Lowest Common Ancestor and Breadth-First Search

```python
class Solution:
    def findDistance(self, root, p, q):
        lca = self._find_LCA(root, p, q)
        bfs = deque([lca])
        distance = 0
        depth = 0
        foundp = False
        foundq = False
        while bfs and (not foundp or not foundq):
            size = len(bfs)
            for i in range(size):
                node = bfs.popleft()  # Dequeue the node
                if node.val == p:
                    distance += depth
                    foundp = True
                if node.val == q:
                    distance += depth
                    foundq = True
                if node.left:
                    bfs.append(node.left)  # Enqueue left child
                if node.right:
                    bfs.append(node.right)  # Enqueue right child
            depth += 1
        return distance

    def _find_LCA(self, root, p, q):
        if root is None or root.val == p or root.val == q:
            return root
        left = self._find_LCA(root.left, p, q)
        right = self._find_LCA(root.right, p, q)
        if left and right:
            return root
        return left if left else right
```

### Approach 3: One pass (Based on Lowest Common Ancestor)

```python
class Solution:
    def findDistance(self, root, p, q):
        return self.__distance(root, p, q, 0)

    # Private helper function
    def __distance(self, root, p, q, depth):
        if root is None or p == q:
            return 0

        # If either p or q is found, calculate the ret_distance as the maximum
        # of depth and ret_distance value for left and right subtrees.
        if root.val == p or root.val == q:
            left = self.__distance(root.left, p, q, 1)
            right = self.__distance(root.right, p, q, 1)

            return max(left, right) if left > 0 or right > 0 else depth

        # Otherwise, calculate the ret_distance as sum of ret_distance of left
        # and right subtree.
        left = self.__distance(root.left, p, q, depth + 1)
        right = self.__distance(root.right, p, q, depth + 1)
        ret_distance = left + right

        # If current node is the LCA, subtract twice of depth.
        if left != 0 and right != 0:
            ret_distance -= 2 * depth

        return ret_distance
```
